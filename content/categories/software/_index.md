The Software Category deals mostly with the efficiency and improvement of software. I have particular interest in software that has the potential to increase workflow efficiency by a great deal (so, for example, Vim rather than Microsoft Word). I am also interested in human computer interaction (HCI) and workflow relating to text interaction with computer systems (both via keyboards and via voice-recognition software).

* Browsers
