The Finances Category deals mostly with the efficiency and improvement of personal finance, spending, and investing. As a rule of thumb, the spending habits that I argue for are those that yield maximum added value per dollar without significant diminishing returns. You can contrast this approach with optimizing for either lowest cost (which saves money but leads to suboptimal overall utility) or highest quality (which brings maximum overall utility, but leads to unnecessary expense).
