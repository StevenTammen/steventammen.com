title: Health

The Health Category deals mostly with the efficiency and improvement of health, excluding exercise and nutrition which are covered in their own separate categories (since they are so important). I am strongly supportive of the idea of preventative medicine (of the “eat lots of vegetables, exercise, and get enough sleep” variety rather than the “Eastern herbal supplements and essential oil aromatherapy” variety, e.g.), and for that reason focus more on optimal wellness than dealing with health problems. I understand and respect the need for discussion of the latter, but this site is not really targeted toward such.

* Optimizing sleep
* Stress management
* Meditation
* Managing addiction and other counterproductive thought patterns
* Dealing with depression, anxiety, and other mental health pressures
* Sex and health
* Social needs and health
* Emotional needs and health
* Improving self-esteem
* Etc.
