title: Gear
---

The Gear Category deals mostly with the efficiency and improvement of physical products. Basically all physical possessions fall into this category (including, for example, houses and cars), as well as the things you might expect more (backpacks, knives, clothing, bikes, etc.). The reason why I use the word “gear” for everything is mostly because I view *all* physical possessions through the same sort of lens as ultralight backpackers might view items in their loadout: as physical purchases with distinct purpose and intended use.

Of note is that all content relating to computer hardware is included in this category. Computers are aggregations of hardware and software (with the line getting a little blurry at the lower levels of computer systems).

This category also includes collections of related objects (“kitchen stuff,” “camping stuff,” and so forth), and explanations regarding the purpose and functionality of these collections.
