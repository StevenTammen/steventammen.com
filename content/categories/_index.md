title: Categories
---

Categories are much broader than subjects within the [Subject Index](/subject-index), with the goal of chunking content into groupings that are mostly mutually exclusive (although not all the time). The categories are listed below, each having a brief summary of the sorts of things contained therein.

## Productivity and Efficiency

The [Productivity and Efficiency Category](/categories/productivity-and-efficiency) deals mostly with the efficiency and improvement of processes.

* Metalearning: study techniques and other processes for more efficient knowledge acquisition.
* Systems of productivity and task management (e.g., Kanban, GTD, Pomodoro Technique, etc.).
* Organization
* Effective planning and goal-setting
* Decision-making
* Process controls
* Etc.

## Gear

The [Gear Category](/categories/gear) deals mostly with the efficiency and improvement of physical products. Basically all physical possessions fall into this category (including, for example, houses and cars), as well as the things you might expect more (backpacks, knives, clothing, bikes, etc.). The reason why I use the word “gear” for everything is mostly because I view *all* physical possessions through the same sort of lens as ultralight backpackers might view items in their loadout: as physical purchases with distinct purpose and intended use.

Of note is that all content relating to computer hardware is included in this category. Computers are aggregations of hardware and software (with the line getting a little blurry at the lower levels of computer systems).

This category also includes collections of related objects (“kitchen stuff,” “camping stuff,” and so forth), and explanations regarding the purpose and functionality of these collections.

## Software

The [Software Category](/categories/software) deals mostly with the efficiency and improvement of software. I have particular interest in software that has the potential to increase workflow efficiency by a great deal (so, for example, Vim rather than Microsoft Word). I am also interested in human computer interaction (HCI) and workflow relating to text interaction with computer systems (both via keyboards and via voice-recognition software).

* Operating systems
* Programming languages
* Browsers
* Terminals
* Text editors
* File explorers
* Window managers
* Task switchers
* Application launchers
* Etc.


## Exercise

The [Exercise Category](/categories/exercise) deals mostly with the efficiency and improvement of exercise, with the goal of maximizing personal fitness.

* Strength training
* High intensity interval training (HIIT)
* Moderate intensity cardio
* Low intensity steady state (LISS) cardio
* Flexibility training
* Recovery
* Injury prevention
* Etc.

## Nutrition

The [Nutrition Category](/categories/nutrition) deals mostly with the efficiency and improvement of nutrition, again with the goal of maximizing personal fitness.

* Macronutrients
* Micronutrients
* Human metabolism
* Appetite and hunger-related endocrinology
* Recipes
* Shopping lists and specific products to buy
* Etc.

## Health 

The [Health Category](/categories/health) deals mostly with the efficiency and improvement of health, excluding exercise and nutrition which are covered in their own separate categories (since they are so important). I am strongly supportive of the idea of preventative medicine (of the “eat lots of vegetables, exercise, and get enough sleep” variety rather than the “Eastern herbal supplements and essential oil aromatherapy” variety, e.g.), and for that reason focus more on optimal wellness than dealing with health problems. I understand and respect the need for discussion of the latter, but this site is not really targeted toward such.

* Optimizing sleep
* Stress management
* Meditation
* Managing addiction and other counterproductive thought patterns
* Dealing with depression, anxiety, and other mental health pressures
* Sex and health
* Social needs and health
* Emotional needs and health
* Improving self-esteem
* Etc.

## Science

The [Science Category](/categories/science) deals mostly with discussion and analysis of scientific research. A list (not exhaustive) of things I am particularly interested in:

* Neuroscience
* Cognitive science
* [“Hard” forms of psychology](https://dictionary.apa.org/hard-psychology) (i.e., research-based, rigorous methodology, data-driven)
* Artificial intelligence and its applications
* Health studies (think PubMed)

In general, however, I’m not picky, so I may end up writing about a pretty wide spread of science topics as things catch my eye.

I’m a stickler for methodological rigor in research, and will consequently end up slamming much that purports to be science. The only things that really count must have a few characteristics:

* They must be experimental rather than observational/retrospective, where possible.
* They must control what lurking variables they can and *effectively* randomize in an attempt to minimize the rest.
* They must have methodological and statistical rigor (avoiding obvious response bias and having large enough sample sizes, for example).
* They must have a control group (where applicable), be double-blind (where applicable), and have a placebo (where applicable).
* They must be conducted by researchers without problematic conflicts of interest or other apparent biases. Exceptions can be made upon reasonable explanation.
* They must be funded by entities without some axe to grind. Exceptions can be made upon reasonable explanation.

The above is what I define as “science”; everything else is just pretending. There’s an enormous amount of poorly conducted research out there.

## Philosophy

The [Philosophy Category](/categories/philosophy) deals mostly with discussion and analysis of topics in philosophy. A list (not exhaustive) of things I am particularly interested in:

* Reason
* Logic
* Belief
* Epistemology
* Skepticism
* Logical fallacies
* Ethics
* Utilitarianism
* The mind-body problem
* Etc.

## Other

The [Other Category](/categories/other) contains things that don’t seem to immediately fit into any of the other categories. Eventually, I may make one or more more new categories, in which case some things would move from Other to the new category or categories.
