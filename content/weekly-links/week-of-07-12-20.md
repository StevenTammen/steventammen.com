- [Forward Email](https://forwardemail.net/en/pricing)
  - A free service that lets you set up custom email addresses like me@mysite.com to forward to a normal email platform (e.g., I just forward emails sent to my custom site addresses to my Gmail account). I used to use routes with Mailgun, but this is easier.
- [Home | Stork Search](https://stork-search.net/)
  - Full text search with Rust compiled into Webassembly.
  - Shows context of search matches rather than just pages that contain matches, which is far superior.
- [A Tiny, Static, Full-Text Search Engine using Rust and WebAssembly | Matthias Endler](https://endler.dev/2019/tinysearch/)
  - Full text search with Rust compiled into Webassembly.
  - Does *not* show context of search matches, but instead just pages that contain matches, which is far inferior.
- [RSS Templates | Hugo](https://gohugo.io/templates/rss/)
  - RSS with Hugo. Hugo automatically generates XML files for sections and taxonomies so that users can subscribe to only the sort of content they are interested in. See [my own RSS page](/rss).
- [Vim.js](http://coolwanglu.github.io/vim.js/emterpreter/vim.html)
  - Vim in the browser with JavaScript.
- [rhysd/vim.wasm: Vim editor ported to WebAssembly](https://github.com/rhysd/vim.wasm)
  - Vim in the browser with Webassembly.
  - Might be able to set it up on a platform like Heroku or Linode with authentication and integration with Dropbox or Google Drive to have a truly anywhere-editor (without having to mess with USB flashdrives and so on)?
  - TODO: Does it support .vimrc files? How interoperable is normal Vim configuration?
