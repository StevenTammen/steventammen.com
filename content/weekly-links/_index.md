title: Weekly Links
---

In this section, I reflect on research and reading I do week-by-week. Much of this reading is done online and can be linked directly, and I link where to buy things that cannot be linked directly (e.g., physical books). Similar to the [Sources section](/sources), I try to mostly keep my comments objective, summarizing what linked resources discuss and what their utility is. Unsurprisingly, many of the things that show up on pages in this section will eventually find their way onto pages in the [Sources section](/sources), as I get around to writing on something formally.
