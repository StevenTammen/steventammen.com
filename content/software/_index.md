title: Software

This section contains software projects that I run. Since I work full-time to support myself, I am able to open-source my code and offer all of my software free of charge, so as many people can take advantage of it as possible. <!-- If you would like to contribute to any of the projects, please see [contribution guidelines](http://blah) -->

Documentation for all the projects is in this section. <!-- Support is available in the corresponding Software sections on the site forums and the Discord server. -->
