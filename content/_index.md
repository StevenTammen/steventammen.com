If you would like to stay up to date with site happenings, you can sign up for the StevenTammen.com mailing list (you may also want to look into [the site's RSS feeds](/rss)). Here is a brief description of the list's mailing frequency and the sort of stuff that shows up in the list's messages:

- While I may occasionally send more or less emails (i.e., the frequency isn't strictly fixed), you can expect on the order of two emails a month from me. I won't spam you.
- Messages typically involve news about the site (including, but certainly not limited to, descriptions of new content available on the site).
