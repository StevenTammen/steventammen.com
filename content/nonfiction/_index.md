title: Nonfiction
---

This section contains nonfiction books that I have written<!-- (or am in the process of writing — see [publishing in progress writing](https://steventammen.com/about-the-site/#publishing-in-progress-writing)) -->. Since I work full-time to support myself, I am able to offer all of my books free of charge, so as many people can take advantage of them as possible.

<!-- Note that often parts of nonfiction books will essentially be complete pages from the Pages section repackaged in a wider work. (Don’t worry, Google doesn’t really punish the site for this duplication: see [/about-the-site](http://blah)). -->
