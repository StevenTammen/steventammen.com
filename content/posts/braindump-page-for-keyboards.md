## This also exists (for now) {#this-also-exists--for-now}

Similar to [last post](https://www.steventammen.com/posts/braindump-page-for-computer-setup-and-ergonomics/): this is an announcement regarding the fact that I have [a braindump page](https://steventammen.com/pages/keyboard-braindump/) up for keyboards (and keyboard layouts). Much of this content is related to the [Typing Extended](https://github.com/StevenTammen/typing-extended) (TypEx) project that I have been working on for a while.

As with the last one, this braindump page (and this post) will probably get deleted eventually as I make use of the information (so be careful linking to it).
