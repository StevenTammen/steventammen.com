- [Review of the cyclete – functionalphysiodotnet](https://functionalphysiodotnet.wordpress.com/2019/01/11/review-of-the-cyclete/)
  - A third-party review of the Cyclete, with comparisons to other stand-up bike options.
- [Cyclete reviews from Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/cyclete/search/?query=review&epa=SEARCH_BOX)
  - This is a link to a saved search in the Facebook group with the keyword "review." You can see what owners have to say about their Cycletes.
  - Keep in mind that the Cyclete is a significant investment, so owners (especially new owners) are more likely than an average third party to be biased in support of their purchase decision (see [choice-supportive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice-supportive_bias)). Note well: I am *not* saying that anyone actually is biased, especially intentionally biased, but just that the risk is there.
