This section, the section with the vast majority of all content on this site, contains my thoughts on a wide variety of subjects.

While the section contains far more than just decision analysis, comparing multiple options and coming to a decision based on solid reasoning and analysis is a favorite pastime of mine, so is certainly well-represented. Please see [/pages/decision-analysis](/pages/decision-analysis) for an in-depth explanation of how I go about the process, and an explanation of the spreadsheets I use as a guide in the process.

Each page in this section has a corresponding page in the [Sources section](/sources) containing an annotated bibliography on the topic.
