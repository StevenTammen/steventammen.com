## 4k vs Multiple HD Monitors {#4k-vs-multiple-hd-monitors}

-   Having one large 4k monitor lets you use the monitor as a TV
-   It also avoids unecessary bezels in normal computing tasks
-   Assuming you have a good tiling window manager, the ease of laying out windows should not be significantly different between the two configurations


## Size and Resolution {#size-and-resolution}

-   Increased screen size without matching increases in resolution has diminishing returns. While a bigger screen will make reading easier, it also means more required travel for your eyes: your eyes have to move a greater distance to read an equivalent amount of text.
    -   For this reason it is probably best to keep 1080p monitors at or under ~27"

-   The increased readability enables you to put two windows side by side, which can increase work efficiency significantly.


## Computer Desktop {#computer-desktop}

-   Black saves power with OLED displays: only turn on pixels that are actually being used
-   Greatest distinguishability between black background and lighter color foreground windows. (foreground windows will be lighter because light backgrounds make text more legible)
-   Worth tradeoff of having picture to remind you of something (e.g., wife, quote, etc.)?
