** Projects related to keyboards and typing efficiency
- [[https://github.com/StevenTammen/hieam][Multilayer keyboard layout for English]]
- [[https://github.com/StevenTammen/unicode-language-layers][Efficient Unicode layers for ancient Greek and Hebrew]]

** Restricted-access projects
- There are several projects from computer science classes that I have stored in private repositories due to restrictions from the University (they recycle projects and do not wish for solutions to be floating around for future students to cheat with). While none of these are incredibly complex (in other words, they may not be an entirely impressive display of ability), I would be happy to provide access upon request.
