- Bluetooth: [[http://handheldsci.com/kb]]

  - LED power consumption (should stay under 200mA): [[https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=75611.0]]

- Kailh Silvers with trimmed Gateron white springs (~25g actuation force, short distance to actuation, long distance to bottom out).
- Stainless plates, with midsection for durability
- [[https://www.amazon.com/Flyboys-Mapstrap/dp/B01DAMTSX4/]] (Leg straps: will need attachment on back of case. Stable? Shift when standing?).
- LED backlight on F-key row

  - For instant layer identification in peripheral/at a glance, allow maximum shinethrough [[https://www.amazon.com/X-keys-Single-Transparent-Keycaps-pk-10/dp/B00FYO8EDC/]]

- Other keys: PimpMyKeyboard flat keys for 1u

  - No backlight on these: don't want to work totally in dark, so backlight only useful for layer indication (waste of money/energy otherwise).
  - [[https://www.quora.com/Is-working-at-a-computer-in-the-dark-bad-for-your-eyes]]

- Two 1.5u keys from [[https://www.shapeways.com/product/CH2JJBLWM/1-x-150?optionId=27111245]] for main thumb keys.
- Match colors to home positions (black everywhere but home position, white home position; however, clear F-keys, as mentioned above).
