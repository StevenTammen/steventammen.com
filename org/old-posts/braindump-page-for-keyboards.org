* This also exists (for now)

Similar to [[https://www.steventammen.com/posts/braindump-page-for-computer-setup-and-ergonomics/][last post]]: this is an announcement regarding the fact that I have [[https://steventammen.com/pages/keyboard-braindump/][a braindump page]] up for keyboards (and keyboard layouts). Much of this content is related to my [[https://github.com/StevenTammen/personal-keyboard-config][personal keyboard project]] that I have been working on for a while.

As with the last one, this braindump page (and this post) will probably get deleted eventually as I make use of the information (so be careful linking to it).
