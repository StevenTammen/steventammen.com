I just put up a page containing a bunch of my recent (and probably somewhat incoherent) thoughts on the ideal computer setup and ergonomics. You can read all about it [[https://www.steventammen.com/pages/computer-setup-and-ergonomics-braindump/][here]].

This page (and this post) will probably get deleted eventually as I make use of the information (so be careful linking to it), but for now, I'll go ahead and dump all my relevant thoughts there. I may do this for a couple other things in the near future. I'll announce those too.
