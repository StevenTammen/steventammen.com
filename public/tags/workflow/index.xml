      <description>Introduction and Motivation Windows doesn&#39;t support a lot of common Unix commands, ssh included.
There are several ways to overcome this fact. The Windows Subsystem for Linux is one option. I&#39;ve used it and it&#39;s certainly a big step up over native windows shells. But to get any GUI applications you have to set up an X server or somesuch (to my knowledge -- which is admittedly limited at present). It&#39;s also a bit of a pain to interface natively with normal Windows files, since you have to use /mnt/c/ to get to to them.</description>
