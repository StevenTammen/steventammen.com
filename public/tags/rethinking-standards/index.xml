When taking in information, we want to make it easiest to form cognitive maps. Some guidelines:

      <description>Safety  Motorcycles are inherently more dangerous than cars due to no barrier between you and other (sometimes incompetent) motorists driving 2-ton metal cages. On the other hand, motorcycles are inherently safer than cars due to 1) better vision (higher up on bikes with upright seating position, no blind spots, can easily head-check), 2) better acceleration, maneuverability, and handling, 3) better attention forced by being more &#34;present&#34; in the act of driving, and 4) better risk awareness: motorcycles make you assume less about your safety and therefore take less risks/be more risk conscious.</description>

      <description>Cursive Vs. Print  Because everything in print uses uses print letterforms, in our day and age, we are more accustomed to reading print letters than cursive letters. Just think about it logically: if most of what we read uses print letterforms, it just makes intuitive sense that we will be more used to reading them, and therefore faster and better at recognizing them. (I.e., they will be more legible to us).</description>
