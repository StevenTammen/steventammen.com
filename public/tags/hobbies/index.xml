      <description>Safety  Motorcycles are inherently more dangerous than cars due to no barrier between you and other (sometimes incompetent) motorists driving 2-ton metal cages. On the other hand, motorcycles are inherently safer than cars due to 1) better vision (higher up on bikes with upright seating position, no blind spots, can easily head-check), 2) better acceleration, maneuverability, and handling, 3) better attention forced by being more &#34;present&#34; in the act of driving, and 4) better risk awareness: motorcycles make you assume less about your safety and therefore take less risks/be more risk conscious.</description>

      <description>Caliber  9mm for compromise between weight, capacity, muzzle velocity (less drop at distance) Jacketed Hollow Point (JHP) rounds nullify many of the advantages that .45 has over 9mm, namely, less overpenetration and wider wound paths (more stopping power). Cheaper for plinking  Frame  Want a double stack for capacity. Makes EDCing a spare mag uneccessary (plus not having to change for more shots is faster than having to change).</description>
