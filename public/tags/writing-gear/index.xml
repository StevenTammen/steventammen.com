      <description>Basic Idea  From a practical standpoint, mechanical pencils are better than wood pencils (worst) and leadholders (not quite as bad, but suboptimal for everyday use outside of a few specific applications). You have to sharpen wood pencils, and you get wood shavings as well as lead shavings. Additionally, if you are writing with a soft lead (as you should be), it will dull very quickly and you will have to sharpen often.</description>

      <description>Lead Grade  Higher softness is better: darker line, writes more smoothly, takes less pressure to deposit graphite on the page. Disadvantages: Smudges easier (especially bad if you&#39;re a lefty) Lead comparison: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73gZFjIAHtw  Lead Width  While it is true that wider leads are smoother (ever try pushing a needle across a piece of paper?), if we posit that lead softness is the main determiner of smoothness, then the net effect is probably small enough that advantages of thinner lead should not be sacrificed for very marginal gains in smoothness â‡’ the lead width should be as large as possible while taking into account the following considerations:   Smaller lead width is better in terms of darkness: the same amount of pressure over a smaller area will lead to a greater force, and more graphite on the page.</description>
