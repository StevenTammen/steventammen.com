      <description>Waterproofing  Don&#39;t need it when it&#39;s not raining, extra unnecessary material   Additionally, want to be able to take off wet layers after rain â‡’ they should be separate Additionally, having waterproof/windproof shell separate from thermal layer means that it is more versatile and can be used across a wider temperature range than a single thermal layer that is waterproof/windproof. Argument could be made that it&#39;s one more jacket to carry around for cold, wet situations, but what if it is cold and rainy in the morning and hot and rainy in the afternoon?</description>

      <description>Always wearing pants  Long pants provide abrasion resistance, water resistance, and sun protection to the legs. Having abrasion resistance on the full length of the legs is useful (rather than just the top). Long pants also help protect against bugs and wind. Long Pants and Safety  Pockets  Pants without pockets are silly. Pockets come in useful for carrying things around day-to-day and also for storing things temporarily if you need too.</description>
