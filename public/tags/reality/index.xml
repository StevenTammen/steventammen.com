      <description>Escaping The Cave This header is a reference to Plato&#39;s Allegory of the Cave. I would encourage you to read that link before continuing on. (Alternatively, one may watch the &#34;red pill blue pill&#34; section of The Matrix, which is essentially Plato&#39;s Allegory of the Cave with with robots and guns).
Some of the readings on this page were introduced to me through a philosophy class that I took during my time at Georgia Tech called PHIL 3127: Science, Technology, and Human Values.</description>
