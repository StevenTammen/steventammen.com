      <description>Limited Time An axiom of existence is the limited nature of time. With normal life responsibilities, there are only so many things that we can spend time on. The more we build discipline and focus, the more we can get to, given our particular set of circumstances. But we will never be able to get to everything. It is necessary that we decide on a method for determining what we focus on, and structure our lives from most important to least important.</description>
