      <description>Disclaimer I have been watching Plover for a long time, but haven&#39;t actually learned very much steno yet (at least physically). Part of this is because the SOFT/HRUF is still yet to ship, and part of it also is because I have been very busy. What I&#39;m trying to say is that my comments should be taken with a large helping of salt. It is entirely possible that there are things in the software that I&#39;m not aware of or am misinformed about.</description>
