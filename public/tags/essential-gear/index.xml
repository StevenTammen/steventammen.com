      <description>Overview Your work environment is simply the collection of objects that play a role in your work. For most of us, that means a keyboard, a monitor, a desk, a chair, and some way to manage sound (headphones/earplugs). Each element of the work environment is briefly discussed below, but ultimately you should do more research. Don&#39;t just take my word for these things.
Keyboard Please have a look at this page.</description>

      <description>Watch Type  Analog watches superior for telling relative time But digital watches have desirable features like stopwatches, timers, day/date, world time, alarms, etc. Therefore, analog-digital watches make sense  Case  Reasonably impact resistant, chemical resistant, magnetic resistant, temperature resistant, pressure resistant/water resistant. Balance good specs with price and use case. Make the lugs about as wide as the watch face (i.e., don&#39;t add width), the thicker the watch band material, the more it distributes pressure on the wrist.</description>

      <description>Waterproofing  Don&#39;t need it when it&#39;s not raining, extra unnecessary material   Additionally, want to be able to take off wet layers after rain ⇒ they should be separate Additionally, having waterproof/windproof shell separate from thermal layer means that it is more versatile and can be used across a wider temperature range than a single thermal layer that is waterproof/windproof. Argument could be made that it&#39;s one more jacket to carry around for cold, wet situations, but what if it is cold and rainy in the morning and hot and rainy in the afternoon?</description>

      <title>Pencils</title>

      <description>Basic Idea  From a practical standpoint, mechanical pencils are better than wood pencils (worst) and leadholders (not quite as bad, but suboptimal for everyday use outside of a few specific applications). You have to sharpen wood pencils, and you get wood shavings as well as lead shavings. Additionally, if you are writing with a soft lead (as you should be), it will dull very quickly and you will have to sharpen often.</description>

      <description>Lead Grade  Higher softness is better: darker line, writes more smoothly, takes less pressure to deposit graphite on the page. Disadvantages: Smudges easier (especially bad if you&#39;re a lefty) Lead comparison: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73gZFjIAHtw  Lead Width  While it is true that wider leads are smoother (ever try pushing a needle across a piece of paper?), if we posit that lead softness is the main determiner of smoothness, then the net effect is probably small enough that advantages of thinner lead should not be sacrificed for very marginal gains in smoothness ⇒ the lead width should be as large as possible while taking into account the following considerations:   Smaller lead width is better in terms of darkness: the same amount of pressure over a smaller area will lead to a greater force, and more graphite on the page.</description>

      <description>Always wearing pants  Long pants provide abrasion resistance, water resistance, and sun protection to the legs. Having abrasion resistance on the full length of the legs is useful (rather than just the top). Long pants also help protect against bugs and wind. Long Pants and Safety  Pockets  Pants without pockets are silly. Pockets come in useful for carrying things around day-to-day and also for storing things temporarily if you need too.</description>

      <description>Essential Features  OLED 4k resolution At least a 60 Hz refresh rate Capable of of 4:4:4 chroma 40+ inches Ability to sleep without messing with windows Low input lag  Preferable Features  Curved (to better fill field of vision at close distances) Smart TV functionality/has remote Modes dependent upon activity (e.g., TV, gaming, etc.). Be able to customize modes.  4k vs Multiple HD Monitors  Having one large 4k monitor lets you use the monitor as a TV It also avoids unecessary bezels in normal computing tasks Assuming you have a good tiling window manager, the ease of laying out windows should not be significantly different between the two configurations  Size and Resolution  Increased screen size without matching increases in resolution has diminishing returns.</description>

      <description>Optimization Variables TODO: determine best order to go through variables. Alphabetically?
TODO: decide if having some sort of weighting scheme would be appropriate, or if leaving it to individuals and their circumstances would be better.
Sweat Management When wearing a backpack for an extended period of time, especially on hot and humid days, it is best to have some way to minimize pack contact with your back. Failing to have such a system leads to excessive sweat buildup, and, over time, smell.</description>
