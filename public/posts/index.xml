      <description>Introduction and Motivation Windows doesn&#39;t support a lot of common Unix commands, ssh included.
There are several ways to overcome this fact. The Windows Subsystem for Linux is one option. I&#39;ve used it and it&#39;s certainly a big step up over native windows shells. But to get any GUI applications you have to set up an X server or somesuch (to my knowledge -- which is admittedly limited at present). It&#39;s also a bit of a pain to interface natively with normal Windows files, since you have to use /mnt/c/ to get to to them.</description>

Bad Reasons To Have a Website First, some reasons I think are lame. A lot of people recommend you have a website to showcase your CV/Resume, your projects, and &#34;what skills and experience you bring to the table.&#34; (You know the type of arguments, and the nauseating language employed therein).</description>

      <description>Blogging can serve a useful purpose, even if it is not perfect I&#39;ve toyed with the idea of blogging for a while now. Part of my initial hesitancy was/is that blogs are these ugly static beasts wherein information never gets updated.
When doing most things in my life, I break patterns in &#34;non-backwards-compatible&#34; ways, as they say. I&#39;ll flip-flop positions, try new things that are exactly the opposite of things I&#39;d previously tried, and go through quick iterative sprints, as much as possible, to figure out what &#34;</description>
