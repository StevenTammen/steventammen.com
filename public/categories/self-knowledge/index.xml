      <description>Argument 1: Objective morality exists Strict materialists often argue that existence is actually futile and that the meaningfulness of life is a charade that we keep up to numb ourselves to the coldness of reality. Under such a supposition, morality is seen through a subjective lens, a human construct propogated by the weak to keep the strong from ruling them absolutely. There is no right and wrong because the universe is governed by uncaring natural laws and humans are merely strings of predictable biological cause and effect drifting to and fro by chance.</description>
