      <title>Fallibility of Human Reason</title>

      <description>Understanding The Fallibility of Human Reason One of the most important things to do after questioning what people are telling you (see &#34;Escaping The Cave&#34;) is to question your own beliefs. We all like to think of ourselves as rational, competent thinkers. The truth is that humans are predisposed to blind spots in our thought, and are, on the whole, incapable of viewing reality as it really is.
Main Idea: As humans, we are biased and irrational in many ways, with a large proportion of these being outside of most people&#39;s awareness.</description>

      <description>Escaping The Cave This header is a reference to Plato&#39;s Allegory of the Cave. I would encourage you to read that link before continuing on. (Alternatively, one may watch the &#34;red pill blue pill&#34; section of The Matrix, which is essentially Plato&#39;s Allegory of the Cave with with robots and guns).
Some of the readings on this page were introduced to me through a philosophy class that I took during my time at Georgia Tech called PHIL 3127: Science, Technology, and Human Values.</description>

      <description>Limited Time An axiom of existence is the limited nature of time. With normal life responsibilities, there are only so many things that we can spend time on. The more we build discipline and focus, the more we can get to, given our particular set of circumstances. But we will never be able to get to everything. It is necessary that we decide on a method for determining what we focus on, and structure our lives from most important to least important.</description>

      <description>Variables  There will be different variables for different items. The first step when researching a particular item or class of item should always be the identification of variables that will be important to optimize around. You will also want to identify the specifics of your particular use case, and weight variables accordingly. &#34;Best&#34; is relative to what the item will be used for -- a really good pair of tactical cargo pants probably won&#39;t be the best pants to go with your suit.</description>

      <title>English Letterforms</title>

      <description>Cursive Vs. Print  Because everything in print uses uses print letterforms, in our day and age, we are more accustomed to reading print letters than cursive letters. Just think about it logically: if most of what we read uses print letterforms, it just makes intuitive sense that we will be more used to reading them, and therefore faster and better at recognizing them. (I.e., they will be more legible to us).</description>

      <title>Using Putty and Emacs&#39; Tramp on Windows</title>

      <description>Introduction and Motivation Windows doesn&#39;t support a lot of common Unix commands, ssh included.
There are several ways to overcome this fact. The Windows Subsystem for Linux is one option. I&#39;ve used it and it&#39;s certainly a big step up over native windows shells. But to get any GUI applications you have to set up an X server or somesuch (to my knowledge -- which is admittedly limited at present). It&#39;s also a bit of a pain to interface natively with normal Windows files, since you have to use /mnt/c/ to get to to them.</description>

      <title>Having a Website and Complications Therein</title>

      <description>A question I have gotten from several people in the few months I&#39;ve had my site up is &#34;what&#39;s the point?&#34; It&#39;s a good question.
Bad Reasons To Have a Website First, some reasons I think are lame. A lot of people recommend you have a website to showcase your CV/Resume, your projects, and &#34;what skills and experience you bring to the table.&#34; (You know the type of arguments, and the nauseating language employed therein).</description>

      <description>Blogging can serve a useful purpose, even if it is not perfect I&#39;ve toyed with the idea of blogging for a while now. Part of my initial hesitancy was/is that blogs are these ugly static beasts wherein information never gets updated.
When doing most things in my life, I break patterns in &#34;non-backwards-compatible&#34; ways, as they say. I&#39;ll flip-flop positions, try new things that are exactly the opposite of things I&#39;d previously tried, and go through quick iterative sprints, as much as possible, to figure out what &#34;</description>
