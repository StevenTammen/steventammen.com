00:00 - hello internet my name is stephen tamman
00:03 - and today i want to go
00:04 - over updating the build image for
00:07 - sites on netlify so a couple weeks back
00:11 - the netlify support people posted a
00:14 - thread
00:14 - uh introducing the topic of
00:18 - updating the build image from i believe
00:20 - it's 14.04 to 20.04 so that's
00:25 - trustee to focal and uh the threads been
00:28 - up a couple weeks and
00:30 - there were some issues for some of us in
00:32 - updating
00:33 - um specifically regarding a ruby version
00:36 - um so i'm coming to do the final update
00:39 - for myself here
00:40 - and one of the guys on the thread just
00:42 - asked your
00:44 - not ask said he was a little bit lost
00:45 - and so i figured while i'm doing this i
00:47 - may as well just record it
00:49 - um so i'm just going to go bottom to top
00:51 - on
00:52 - basically where you go on the netlify
00:54 - dashboard and what the things you should
00:56 - do and what the order is so hopefully
00:58 - this will help
00:59 - uh you know and anyone else who maybe
01:02 - hasn't done this before or you know
01:04 - hasn't had to deal with the settings
01:06 - you know it is probably a bit confusing
01:08 - i mean i certainly was confused the
01:10 - first time i did it
01:11 - so when you start on your netlify
01:14 - dashboard like this let me see i have
01:15 - two sites on netlify right now
01:18 - you can click on the site that you have
01:21 - and then
01:22 - on this page there will be a list of
01:25 - deploys
01:26 - so these are the builds of your site
01:29 - in order at the top is the most recent
01:31 - one and
01:32 - as you scroll down you get less recent
01:34 - ones so what you want to do is click on
01:37 - this header here called production
01:38 - deploys
01:40 - now since we are going to be changing
01:43 - the build version you probably don't
01:45 - want it to go live
01:46 - on your site immediately so the first
01:49 - thing you should do is click this button
01:50 - here called stop out up
01:52 - stop auto publishing and what that will
01:55 - do is it will lock your production
01:56 - deploy
01:57 - to the last one that was successful so
02:00 - we're going to go ahead and do that for
02:01 - this site
02:02 - and now you should see that there's a
02:04 - lock next to the published here
02:07 - so now what we're going to go do is
02:09 - we're going to go ahead and bump the
02:10 - build
02:10 - image so you're going to click on the
02:12 - button that i just clicked on there
02:14 - so on the deploys page for this and how
02:18 - we got here from
02:19 - my dashboard was um i clicked on the
02:22 - site
02:23 - and then i went and clicked on
02:25 - production deploys
02:27 - and then i clicked on deploy settings
02:29 - from here
02:30 - so once you're on this page you're going
02:33 - to have to scroll down
02:34 - until you find a section that says build
02:38 - image selection
02:39 - and so right now you see that i'm
02:40 - running ubuntu trustee
02:42 - 14.04 so this is the old build image
02:46 - and i'm going to want to update this to
02:48 - the newest one
02:50 - now the latest stable one is 1604 but
02:53 - if we're doing it i kind of figure we
02:55 - may as well do it for the new one
02:57 - so we're going to go ahead and select
02:58 - that here and then we're going to press
03:00 - save
03:01 - now before we trigger a build i'm going
03:04 - to go ahead and re-link
03:06 - the repository that my site is being
03:09 - built from
03:10 - because one of the guys helping us debug
03:13 - in the thread
03:14 - had decided that some of the package
03:17 - dependencies that we were having issues
03:19 - with
03:20 - were getting linked from the first time
03:22 - that you linked the repository to
03:23 - netlify
03:24 - so some dependencies got set and
03:28 - it's not perhaps the greatest
03:29 - documentation because nowhere are you
03:31 - seeing
03:32 - where these versions are but he said
03:35 - that the way that you fix this is to go
03:38 - to the
03:38 - bill in the build and deploy section go
03:41 - to the one that says build settings
03:44 - so we're on the same page the one that
03:46 - we scrolled down on now that we've
03:47 - picked
03:48 - focal so 20.04 is the build image we're
03:51 - going to go up
03:52 - to the build settings section here now
03:55 - you can see the github repository that
03:57 - i'm deploying my site from
03:58 - is this one here so i'm going to go
04:00 - ahead and i'm just going to go
04:02 - get rid of it and then i'm going to link
04:03 - it again so i'm going to press edit
04:05 - settings
04:06 - and say link to a different repository
04:08 - now i'm going to authenticate with
04:10 - github
04:11 - because my git repository is on github
04:14 - so once we've authenticated
04:17 - via the api here i'm going to go ahead
04:20 - and select that same repository again
04:23 - so i have quite a few repositories as
04:25 - you can see but
04:26 - we're going to search just for
04:30 - the well okay that's not helpful we're
04:32 - going to search for this one
04:34 - the one that i'm deploying my site from
04:37 - and going to be deploying the master
04:41 - branch
04:42 - and we're not going to change anything
04:44 - different here these are
04:45 - all the things that i had before the
04:47 - public directory
04:49 - and so i have just re-linked the build
04:51 - repository for the site
04:53 - and so when we do that it will take us
04:57 - back to the deploy page here
05:00 - and we just re-linked it uh
05:03 - and we have updated the build image
05:06 - all right well i paused for a second
05:08 - there to let it finish
05:10 - and if i go ahead and click on the
05:12 - newest build
05:13 - so if you remember we went ahead and
05:15 - locked our builds
05:16 - so we have the last published one is
05:18 - still up and now you'll notice that
05:19 - there's
05:20 - one deployment ahead of this so this is
05:22 - what we did
05:23 - after we re-linked the repository it
05:25 - went ahead and rebuilt the site
05:27 - so if we go look at this now and we look
05:29 - at the log
05:30 - the deploy log here you'll see that it
05:33 - said that
05:33 - the build was successful and this is a
05:36 - good thing
05:37 - because i am not specifying any versions
05:40 - so previously when i'd updated from the
05:43 - trusty build image to the focal build
05:45 - image
05:46 - i was getting an error because it was
05:49 - having problems installing an old
05:51 - version of ruby
05:52 - but now that we've re-linked the
05:55 - repository
05:56 - it is picking up the dependencies just
05:58 - fine from
06:00 - the focal build image so the defaults
06:02 - there
06:03 - and is building the site that way and in
06:05 - fact because it's not trying to install
06:08 - an
06:08 - old dependency version i believe it was
06:10 - ruby 2.3
06:12 - it was installing it actually builds a
06:14 - lot faster
06:15 - because it's using the default versions
06:18 - of you can see python here
06:20 - node ruby php you know i'm building my
06:23 - static site with the hugo static site
06:26 - generator
06:26 - but all of the dependencies aren't
06:28 - taking up build time now
06:30 - so what i'm going to go ahead and do now
06:32 - is i'm just going to go ahead and do
06:33 - exactly the same thing
06:35 - for the other side that i run so
06:38 - just going ahead and reviewing what we
06:40 - do so you
06:41 - go from your dashboard to the site and
06:43 - then you click on production deploys
06:46 - and then you stop auto publishing just
06:48 - in case you break something
06:50 - while you're trying to update then you
06:53 - go to
06:53 - deploy settings and you scroll down
06:56 - until you find
06:58 - build image and then you update the
07:01 - build image
07:02 - youtube whichever one you want one of
07:04 - the newer ones i'm going to be doing
07:06 - the most updated one so focal
07:10 - and then we go ahead and re-link the
07:12 - repository again
07:14 - so you can see this one's a different
07:15 - git repository but the same process as
07:17 - we did last time
07:20 - so again i'm going to authenticate with
07:22 - github
07:23 - because that's where i have my
07:24 - repository
07:26 - and once we've authenticated i'm going
07:28 - to go down
07:30 - and re-link exactly the same repository
07:32 - that we had before
07:34 - oops well i guess it was on the first
07:36 - page all right
07:38 - so here it is here's the repository and
07:40 - all the builds gonna stay the same as it
07:42 - was so again i'm using hugo as my static
07:45 - site generator but some of this might be
07:46 - different for you
07:48 - if you're using a different one and so
07:50 - once we press this deploy site button
07:52 - you're going to see that it's going to
07:54 - go ahead and start a build here
07:56 - so i'm going to pause again and we'll
07:57 - wait for this one to finish too
07:59 - and then i'll make some closing comments
08:02 - all right so now my second site here has
08:04 - built and if we go
08:06 - look at this deploy summary in the log
08:08 - you'll see that we had
08:10 - exactly the same sort of setup as on my
08:13 - other site
08:13 - so all the green checks and all of the
08:16 - dependencies installed
08:17 - and so that means that i've now updated
08:20 - both of my sites to be using the new
08:22 - build image
08:23 - now the last thing that we want to do
08:26 - and this is important so you don't want
08:27 - to forget it
08:28 - is to start auto publishing again so
08:31 - next time you push a commit
08:32 - to the linked repository that means that
08:35 - netlify will run its continuous
08:37 - integration to go ahead and build your
08:39 - site
08:40 - automatically so i'm going to go ahead
08:42 - and
08:43 - start it again on this site so now that
08:45 - we've successfully published you'll see
08:47 - that the lock went away
08:48 - that means that next time something gets
08:51 - pushed to the branch
08:52 - the site will rebuild and so i'm going
08:54 - to go ahead and do that
08:56 - on my other site as well
08:59 - so i'm going to click on production
09:01 - deploys and then
09:03 - start auto publishing all right so one
09:06 - last thing i want to talk about in this
09:08 - video and that
09:09 - is the netlify.tamul file
09:12 - that specifies the build settings here
09:15 - so you can see
09:16 - that i am on the github repository for
09:19 - one of the sites that i just
09:20 - bumped the build image for and i just
09:23 - wanted to give folks an idea if they
09:25 - already didn't know
09:26 - about what this sort of thing looks like
09:29 - so
09:30 - you'll recognize these things from when
09:32 - i was linking the repository
09:34 - these are the defaults i believe for
09:36 - hugo so this is the directory that we're
09:38 - publishing the site out of
09:39 - and this is the command that's going to
09:42 - get run on netlify server
09:44 - um and you can see here i'm actually
09:45 - running a pretty out of date version of
09:47 - hugo
09:48 - because my theme has some uh
09:51 - code that has been deprecated in later
09:52 - versions but
09:54 - uh really what i wanted to show here was
09:56 - that if you have
09:57 - a specific version of say ruby or php
10:01 - or some other language that your site
10:03 - relies on
10:04 - you can actually set the version right
10:06 - here
10:07 - in the environment section and so
10:10 - before i just came and updated the site
10:13 - to build
10:14 - by relinking i was actually specifying
10:17 - a ruby version right here to get it to
10:20 - build
10:20 - because there was a problem with an
10:23 - earlier ruby version
10:25 - on the most recent build image so i was
10:27 - just going to say that if you do need to
10:29 - specify a version
10:31 - rather than letting the environment pick
10:33 - it when you relink the repository
10:35 - this file right here is where you do it
