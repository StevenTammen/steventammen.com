00:00 - hey guys my name is stephen tamman and
00:02 - today
00:03 - i'm going to be going over the sprint
00:05 - planning for
00:06 - sprint number two in the work
00:08 - organization
00:09 - of all the stuff i do out of my outside
00:12 - of my job
00:13 - so earlier this morning i made a video
00:15 - uh going over the review and the retro
00:17 - for the first sprint
00:19 - um but this video here is going to be
00:21 - talking about all of the work we have
00:22 - upcoming
00:23 - for the next two weeks in my cycle here
00:26 - um so last sprint uh the burn down was
00:29 - not real pretty because
00:30 - i ended up not really doing many of
00:33 - these things relating to the website
00:34 - that i had planned
00:35 - um so this sprint we'll see if maybe i
00:38 - can uh
00:39 - not wander so much in the things i work
00:41 - on and get more of that stuff done
00:44 - i mean if not you know uh no no harm
00:46 - done you know i it can roll over
00:48 - uh as it needs to you know because last
00:51 - print for example i had the
00:53 - uh the write-up of audio normalization
00:57 - and cleaning up the audio on videos and
00:59 - all of that stuff was necessary but i
01:01 - just hadn't anticipated it beforehand
01:03 - but at any rate today um all of these
01:06 - things that you see here so
01:08 - the order number 7 to 14 here these were
01:10 - actually all tasks that we already went
01:12 - over
01:12 - from the sprint planning video the last
01:14 - time so all of these things
01:16 - are relating to the establishment of the
01:19 - ministry website that i've been working
01:20 - on
01:20 - and in particular they're dealing with
01:23 - the theme
01:24 - so the website theme that i am coding um
01:27 - you know open source
01:28 - so that's what is behind uh
01:31 - my ministry website so
01:36 - um right here the site that we have
01:39 - going up everything you see
01:40 - in the sidebar and if we go to a page
01:43 - that has content you'll see the
01:45 - dynamically scrolling table of contents
01:47 - and
01:47 - all of that is corresponding to the
01:50 - theme that i've built
01:52 - so the thing is to document all of the
01:55 - features for the theme here
01:56 - um it's necessary for me to write that
01:59 - up
02:00 - um so that's what these tasks are and as
02:03 - i mentioned
02:03 - in the first print planning video the
02:06 - reason why
02:07 - these things are going to end up on my
02:08 - personal website is because eventually i
02:10 - may not be the only person using this
02:12 - theme
02:13 - and so rather than having many
02:14 - documentation pages on
02:16 - say this website here which is going
02:19 - over
02:20 - the uh you know just just the ministry
02:23 - stuff so bible teaching
02:24 - um well if i have the documentation on
02:28 - a project page on my personal site then
02:30 - if other people ever end up using this
02:32 - then the documentation will already be
02:34 - there and multiple people can link to it
02:36 - so i'm not gonna really spend much more
02:38 - time talking about these things
02:40 - um you know we will open up the uh the
02:42 - task board here you know all of these
02:43 - tasks have remained essentially
02:45 - unchanged just because i never really
02:46 - started them last sprint
02:48 - so they've all rolled over we've got the
02:50 - hours and the efforts from those things
02:52 - um now in this sprint um
02:55 - now we have all of the tasks here for
02:58 - the
02:59 - the videos in the upcoming weeks here so
03:01 - the sprints are two weeks long
03:03 - so this first week we've got the
03:05 - discussion group video so there's three
03:06 - of those that
03:07 - happen on saturdays and then lesson four
03:10 - video and q a
03:11 - lesson five video in q a and the second
03:13 - discussion videos from next saturday as
03:15 - well
03:15 - you can see that i've already started um
03:17 - because this happened earlier this
03:18 - afternoon i've already done the prep and
03:19 - we've already done the recordings here
03:21 - i actually have them processing right at
03:23 - the moment
03:24 - but those are all the video tasks and in
03:27 - fact
03:28 - in future sprint plannings i really
03:29 - probably won't talk about the all that
03:31 - much because
03:32 - i'm expecting the time and the hours now
03:34 - that i've gotten a better feel for it
03:36 - i'm expecting them to stay relatively
03:38 - relatively stable and consistent
03:40 - so the discussion groups we've efforted
03:42 - them at five
03:43 - um i have a chart here now
03:47 - depending on the process
03:50 - you have going you might have a
03:52 - correspondency here you know we effort
03:54 - things with fibonacci
03:55 - numbers because the specificity
03:59 - that we can task things at kind of
04:02 - gets finer as the tasks are smaller so
04:04 - when you have a really big task
04:06 - it can be much more difficult to
04:08 - estimate
04:09 - you know how much effort it's going to
04:11 - take um so that's why
04:12 - as you get bigger as tasks get bigger we
04:14 - get less precise
04:16 - because it's much harder to estimate
04:17 - things that are larger in size and you
04:19 - can see the hour ranges
04:20 - also proportionally get bigger so these
04:22 - are what i've decided
04:23 - um so for my my workflow here which is
04:27 - all of my time x out you know external
04:29 - to work
04:30 - and uh working out and eating and all of
04:33 - the other things that
04:34 - are part of life this is this is the
04:36 - time i'm gonna try to sink into
04:37 - my personal project so you can see here
04:39 - over in the
04:41 - uh in the work details pane that i've
04:43 - tasked myself at about 56 hours
04:45 - for this friend that's including my work
04:47 - time on weekends
04:48 - so the time that i'm anticipating being
04:50 - on task
04:51 - uh working on things on weekends so that
04:54 - puts me
04:55 - well 52 hours over the course of two
04:58 - weeks
04:59 - so this is about actually it's about 20
05:02 - uh what is that 28 hours a week of four
05:05 - hours a day that's the capacity that
05:07 - i've tasked myself at here as you can
05:09 - see four hours per
05:10 - day and that's going to be a little bit
05:11 - less than four hours a day on weekdays
05:13 - and
05:13 - of course a little bit more than that on
05:15 - weekends um so that's how this is going
05:17 - to work here but
05:18 - so 26 hours a week on top of my my
05:20 - normal job but these are how the hour
05:22 - breakdowns are stacking up and again
05:24 - this is just what i'm using
05:26 - um different teams may use slightly
05:27 - different correspondences here
05:29 - um and all of these things are
05:31 - essentially estimates um but
05:33 - you can see that these discussion group
05:35 - tasks for the saturday videos because it
05:37 - takes me
05:38 - a good bit of time in post-processing to
05:40 - put timestamps on them while those get a
05:41 - bigger effort
05:42 - they correspond to about seven hours of
05:44 - work whereas each one of these smaller
05:46 - videos so this video and this q a video
05:48 - each of those are
05:49 - under two and a half hours so those get
05:51 - smaller efforts right
05:53 - so you can see that that's the effort
05:54 - breakdown so over here for sprint two
05:57 - the next two week period from end of
05:59 - july to beginning of august 2021
06:01 - we've got 15 overall tasks 37 subtasks
06:05 - the planned effort of 45. i mean we'll
06:07 - see again how much i stick to this what
06:08 - the burn down looks like at the end
06:11 - but that's the gist of things so i
06:13 - mentioned the capacity here
06:15 - um and only other thing that i may want
06:18 - to note here is i made a task here for
06:20 - meetings as well
06:21 - and so conventionally you don't really
06:22 - track this in the effort tracking
06:24 - because it's not like it's really work
06:25 - you accomplish this is sort of the meta
06:27 - stuff
06:27 - so i gave myself one and a half hours
06:29 - here for sprint planning i was
06:31 - organizing everything pulling it into
06:32 - this sprint making this video
06:34 - posting this video review in retro this
06:36 - is going to be the task for next week so
06:38 - i did a review and retro video earlier
06:40 - today but
06:40 - that was from the last sprint and then
06:42 - backlog refinement at some point
06:44 - throughout here
06:44 - i'll probably want to go to the wider
06:46 - backlog so if i
06:48 - open this up here i might look at the
06:52 - let me pull out the menu i might look at
06:54 - the bigger backlog
06:55 - that's external to the sprint because
06:57 - i've already actually sequenced a fair
06:59 - bit of the work that is going to need to
07:00 - get done later so you can see here
07:02 - that i have some stuff from sprint 1
07:05 - that is there and then
07:06 - all of this other stuff from sprint 2
07:08 - and then down here we just have the
07:10 - iteration path as just my project in
07:12 - general
07:13 - so this is all the combined work
07:15 - repositories that i have i have like
07:17 - three or four of them right now my two
07:18 - websites the website theme and then a
07:20 - keyboard project
07:21 - but all of these things i have in the
07:23 - backlog for me to pull in in the future
07:26 - well it takes time to organize things
07:27 - and get them
07:28 - in what we call the ready state in agile
07:31 - software development
07:32 - which basically means you're ready to
07:34 - pull it into a sprint to work on it um
07:35 - so getting things in the ready state
07:37 - that's what backlog refinement is and
07:39 - typically do that sometime in the middle
07:40 - of the sprint you know as you're
07:42 - you get more information about things
07:44 - that you can uh uh sort of
07:46 - estimate the size of and see if you're
07:48 - ready see if you've
07:49 - got dependent dependent task done um
07:53 - so i'll be doing that as well um so
07:55 - that's really all all there is to it i
07:56 - mean i don't think in the future
07:58 - that these uh sprint planning videos are
07:59 - going to be super long
08:01 - as i say in future videos i'm probably
08:03 - just going to basically say yep this is
08:04 - the video stuff
08:05 - um you know if we look at the backlog
08:07 - for the sprint well
08:08 - the first few tasks are always just
08:10 - going to be the uh
08:11 - across two weeks is going to be a total
08:13 - of 10 videos so one two three
08:15 - four you know that's the uh the videos
08:18 - and the q and a videos of my own
08:19 - production and then three videos
08:21 - per saturday um so for a total of 10
08:23 - over two weeks
08:24 - um so the 10 videos it a little over two
08:27 - hours of pop for the videos you know
08:28 - maybe
08:29 - 11 hours of total of total time for the
08:31 - videos
08:32 - well then there's everything else on top
08:33 - of that and that's going to be generally
08:34 - what's more interesting because
08:36 - the things that i work on on top of this
08:38 - consistent time drain
08:40 - will be the things that change from time
08:41 - to time but the reason why this video
08:43 - isn't going to drag on as i say is
08:44 - because we already talked about all this
08:46 - stuff
08:46 - in the last sprint planning and i just
08:48 - didn't get to it so none of the tasks
08:50 - that i have
08:51 - yet to do have really changed that much
08:53 - they're just rolling over into this next
08:55 - sprint
08:56 - so there you have it um we look at the
08:58 - task board i've tasked myself a little
09:00 - bit under
09:01 - the total capacity i have this is
09:03 - actually not a typical
09:05 - on my work teams we typically task
09:07 - ourselves in our sprints to maybe
09:09 - 85 or 90 with the understanding that
09:12 - stuff comes up
09:12 - there's unexpected situations um you
09:15 - know maybe you get dragged over to help
09:16 - someone else and stuff and
09:18 - we don't actually we don't actually set
09:19 - our capacity to full eight hours a day
09:21 - either
09:22 - so typically at work on development days
09:24 - we set ourselves at six and a half
09:25 - because you have to answer email and you
09:28 - know do
09:28 - do training and administrative things
09:31 - you know all of that takes time as well
09:33 - but even there we don't ask ourselves
09:36 - all the way out just because
09:38 - it's dangerous if you do if you rely on
09:40 - that because
09:41 - well what what happens if something
09:42 - comes up so you just leave a little bit
09:43 - of a buffer for uncertainty and i did
09:45 - better at that
09:46 - this time i think so you know with the
09:48 - remaining days left in the sprint i've
09:49 - got 52
09:50 - so that's you know 4 times 13 here so 13
09:54 - more days left in this sprint
09:56 - and that gives me you know a little bit
09:58 - of a buffer here
09:59 - so that hopefully i'll be able to
10:01 - complete the tasks i've laid out for
10:02 - myself
10:03 - um and once we get to the end of this
10:04 - there'll just be a few more things left
10:06 - to do on that website and then hopefully
10:07 - i'll ping the mailing list and go ahead
10:09 - and launch completely
10:10 - so that's the goal um we'll see it might
10:13 - be possible in the future for me to trim
10:14 - a bit of time off of the video
10:16 - preparation as well
10:17 - as i get a little bit more familiar with
10:20 - it but i really think that the hours
10:22 - that we have here
10:23 - are going to stay reasonably consistent
10:26 - as we go from sprint to sprint
10:28 - so that's all i got today
10:32 - and next time we will be posting a video
10:35 - talking about the review and the retro
10:37 - of this sprint so we'll see
10:39 - exactly how many of these tasks i
10:41 - managed to complete in the two-week
10:42 - period
10:43 - so thanks for watching and we'll catch
10:45 - you next time
