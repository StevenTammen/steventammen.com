00:00 - hey guys what is up my name is stephen
00:02 - tamman
00:03 - and today i'm going to be talking about
00:06 - the organization plan that i have moving
00:08 - forward for the next couple weeks
00:10 - so i use this platform right here
00:13 - called devops so this is azure devops a
00:16 - service i
00:17 - offered by microsoft all the time at my
00:19 - job as a software engineer
00:21 - and so i had this idea a couple weeks
00:24 - back of well
00:25 - you know i have a lot of tasks that i
00:27 - organize in my
00:28 - projects outside of work and so why
00:30 - don't i go ahead and put all that
00:32 - experience i have
00:33 - to use um so i've actually been very
00:36 - happy
00:36 - with using the devops interface to
00:39 - organize my personal life
00:41 - i kind of wish i'd done it sooner
00:42 - honestly like back in college when i had
00:44 - even more things that i had to organize
00:47 - but i'll go over all that probably in a
00:49 - separate video
00:50 - today what i want to talk about is what
00:53 - i have on my agenda for the next two
00:55 - weeks
00:56 - so those of us in software engineering
00:58 - who develop on
01:00 - agile um the agile framework of software
01:03 - development
01:04 - i guess specifically my team does scrum
01:06 - but at any rate we
01:07 - do these things called sprints which are
01:09 - basically two week periods
01:11 - in which you plan out your work
01:14 - so you get a number of tasks and you you
01:18 - make sub points for them which we'll get
01:19 - to in a second here
01:21 - and you organize your work in these two
01:24 - weeks
01:25 - two week sprints and then after that's
01:27 - done
01:28 - you review what you did it's called
01:30 - sprint review
01:31 - and then you do a retro or retrospective
01:34 - to talk about what went well and what
01:36 - didn't so that you can learn
01:38 - and then of course what happens at the
01:40 - beginning of a sprint is called sprint
01:42 - planning
01:43 - and that's kind of what we're doing
01:44 - today i'm going to go over all of the
01:46 - things that i'm planning on knocking out
01:47 - in the next two weeks
01:49 - uh talk about some of the decisions i'm
01:51 - making here
01:52 - um in this more than anything else is
01:54 - just to give people who are interested
01:56 - in what i'm doing you know not that i
01:58 - think everyone in the world is going to
02:01 - be particularly interested but just in
02:02 - case anyone is
02:04 - this will give them a snapshot of what
02:06 - i'm planning on working on
02:08 - and the effort i'm going to be putting
02:09 - in so
02:11 - this right here is the full list of
02:14 - tasks that i'm planning on
02:15 - knocking out in the next two weeks um so
02:18 - this view right here is
02:20 - called the backlog view so i have a
02:22 - wider backlog here
02:24 - of work items that is going to span
02:27 - basically all of the sprints that i'm
02:29 - going to be doing in the near future so
02:30 - you can see
02:31 - i've actually got written up here let me
02:34 - knock that sidebar out a little bit
02:36 - um a backlog here that's not just unique
02:39 - to
02:40 - sprint one this first sprint that i'm
02:42 - organizing from
02:44 - july 17th to july 30th but also just
02:48 - for the foreseeable future i'm lining
02:50 - things up
02:51 - getting them in a ready state so that i
02:53 - can pull them into
02:55 - another organization cycle another
02:56 - sprint to work on later
02:58 - um so at any rate this time though we're
03:01 - looking at just the first sprint
03:03 - so if i want to see the backlog for just
03:06 - the sprint i can go to the sprint view
03:08 - and that's what we're looking at right
03:09 - here
03:11 - so this is the board for the sprint
03:15 - and so you may have heard of an
03:17 - organization system called kanban
03:19 - and so this is similar to that
03:22 - with perhaps the difference that we have
03:25 - all of these
03:26 - you know to do doing done visually
03:28 - mapped out here by tasks
03:30 - kanban tends to have tasks in columns
03:33 - rather than
03:33 - you know horizontally blocking them like
03:35 - this but at any rate
03:37 - you know i find the visual presentation
03:39 - very helpful in terms of organizing work
03:41 - and so i was just showing the backlog
03:44 - view here that lists all of the tasks in
03:45 - this
03:46 - sprint all the things i want to be doing
03:47 - for the next two weeks but in talking
03:50 - about this
03:50 - i'm actually going to go through and
03:53 - we're going to look at
03:54 - we're going to look at what i have
03:56 - tasked for myself explicitly
03:58 - with the subtasks for each issue so i'm
04:01 - not going to spend a great deal of time
04:03 - here on any one of these things but i
04:04 - just want to give people an idea
04:06 - of what it is that i'm going to be
04:07 - working on so one of the things i'm
04:09 - going to do i've put this off for a
04:10 - while i try to chunk
04:12 - the amazon orders that i do so i make a
04:14 - list of things that i'm planning on
04:16 - buying you know
04:17 - i do have an amazon prime subscription
04:19 - but nonetheless i still kind of
04:21 - just to save shipping materials and all
04:23 - that try to sort of bundle stuff
04:25 - so one of the things i've been thinking
04:27 - of doing for a while here is anytime i
04:29 - have
04:30 - something that i'm buying you know i
04:32 - tend to
04:33 - come up with justifications for myself
04:35 - you know so that i don't just
04:36 - impulsively buy things
04:38 - um but it cost me
04:41 - not pretty not a lot of time at all to
04:43 - just turn on a recording and
04:45 - basically just you know word vomit all
04:48 - of my thoughts about why i'm buying this
04:49 - and why i'm buying that
04:51 - and now that i have my video you know my
04:54 - video recording
04:55 - and editing software set up and also the
04:58 - program that automatically
04:59 - removes silence from videos so that i
05:01 - can sort of set up takes easier and all
05:04 - that
05:04 - it doesn't cost me very much time and i
05:06 - think it might be helpful
05:08 - you know just in case anyone else is
05:10 - interested in any of the stuff that i'm
05:11 - presently buying um so i'm gonna kick
05:14 - that off this week
05:15 - i don't think it'll take me super long
05:16 - like i said since i should just be able
05:18 - to go
05:19 - um and then i have all of the content
05:21 - planning
05:22 - for the youtube channel that is
05:24 - basically just coming online
05:26 - so for a long time um you know i am
05:29 - going to be running
05:30 - a bible teaching website you know
05:32 - something that i feel like i'm
05:33 - personally called to
05:34 - um but for a long time i thought that
05:36 - was going to be pretty
05:38 - focused on text so text studies like
05:40 - this you know you see the table of
05:41 - contents over on the right
05:43 - that is basically purely written i mean
05:46 - it's got some fancy stuff like the
05:47 - footnotes and all that as well but
05:49 - um not video basically however
05:53 - talking to several people and with some
05:55 - experience um i've
05:56 - shifted not away from that you know i'm
05:58 - still going to have
05:59 - a high focus on text but i'm also going
06:02 - to be doing more videos
06:04 - and so i spent a lot of time the last
06:06 - little bit thinking about
06:07 - how to do that um specifically how to
06:10 - organize videos so that they're short
06:12 - you know 20 to 25 minutes
06:14 - makes it a lot easier for people to
06:16 - digest also organized
06:18 - so writing outlines referring back to
06:20 - outlines throughout the video
06:22 - so that the videos stay very focused and
06:24 - then the third really big
06:26 - key point that i'm going to try to
06:27 - emphasize is time stamping all the
06:29 - videos
06:29 - so it's actually harder than you think
06:31 - especially when you have a group of
06:32 - people
06:33 - to get time stamps for all the topics
06:36 - you discuss in a video
06:37 - if you control it it's pretty easy uh
06:40 - you just
06:40 - control the topics you do you you show
06:42 - it somewhere on the screen and then you
06:44 - go back and post
06:45 - post-production of the video and you add
06:47 - them yourself but if
06:49 - you can't control the topic so people
06:51 - talk about random things it's a lot
06:52 - harder than you think but
06:53 - you know i've spent some time thinking
06:55 - about that and i'm going to try to time
06:56 - stamp everything
06:57 - so i launched my own teaching series
07:01 - last week or i guess this week i suppose
07:04 - um two videos up from that so far
07:06 - um and that will continue probably two
07:08 - videos a week there of just me
07:10 - and then the meeting we have been having
07:13 - on saturdays where we've been posting
07:14 - these hour and a half
07:16 - maybe two hour long videos i'm gonna try
07:18 - to split those recordings in three
07:20 - so maybe three 20 to 25 minute
07:22 - recordings
07:23 - and with full timestamps so all of these
07:26 - things are going to take time for me
07:28 - and so i'm trying to budget that
07:30 - explicitly into the planning i have here
07:32 - so over here on the right we have
07:34 - the work breakdown here you know i've
07:36 - assigned all these tasks to myself
07:38 - um capacity wise i've said i'm gonna
07:41 - work
07:42 - all seven days of the week for two hours
07:44 - a day um now if i get up in the morning
07:46 - that gives me a couple hours before work
07:48 - when i can just focus on getting things
07:50 - done so that's the plan we'll see if i
07:52 - stick with it or not
07:53 - um but that you know 14 times two gives
07:56 - me 28 total hours and you see i've taxed
07:58 - myself
07:58 - all the way out to that 28. now of
08:00 - course these are just time estimates you
08:02 - know sometimes they take longer
08:03 - sometimes they don't take as long
08:04 - but it's a good way of tracking your
08:06 - progress so that you at least
08:08 - set reasonable goals for yourself so
08:11 - where i was going with all this video
08:12 - stuff
08:13 - was that i have tasks set out to prepare
08:16 - some stuff to make the recordings go
08:17 - smoother
08:18 - for those hour and a half recordings we
08:20 - do on saturdays and then also some
08:22 - some time there to build time
08:25 - and to write summaries for each of the
08:26 - videos so not to get too technical but
08:29 - i'm actually going to be pulling the
08:31 - automatic transcriptions from youtube
08:33 - and we're going to try to say a key
08:36 - phrase i'm thinking probably the words
08:38 - new topic
08:39 - when we're transitioning topics so this
08:41 - is the new topic we'll be talking about
08:43 - or now i want to talk about this new
08:45 - topic or however people want to say it
08:47 - as long as they include those words
08:49 - i'll be able to download the
08:50 - transcription file search on that phrase
08:53 - and then create timestamps from that and
08:56 - what's really cool about this is when i
08:57 - use
08:58 - the command line tool to remove silence
09:01 - from the video i mean it's basically a
09:03 - wrapper for
09:04 - ffmpeg for anyone who's interested um it
09:07 - automatically removes audio silence from
09:09 - the videos
09:10 - well i can run that tool and i can still
09:12 - use the time stamps because i'll upload
09:15 - the cut video post process to youtube
09:17 - and it will then generate the subtitles
09:20 - so pretty neat technical but it takes a
09:22 - little bit of time to go ahead and
09:24 - and control f to find the topic
09:26 - transitions to add the timestamps
09:28 - because i'll
09:28 - also have to write out the topics here
09:30 - and i'll have to listen to
09:32 - what we say when we say new topic and
09:34 - then write that down and then i have
09:36 - the general tasks for making lessons
09:39 - in the video teaching series i'm doing
09:41 - on you know this study
09:43 - um and so we have early in the week the
09:47 - pre-recorded video i do you know i have
09:48 - to prepare the slides and then
09:50 - after i make the video i have to post
09:52 - them you know link them on the website
09:54 - write the summary time stamp it
09:56 - and then do that again for the q a video
09:58 - that we have later in the week if people
10:00 - have any questions on that
10:02 - and then we have these two tasks so
10:04 - sprints are two weeks so i'm going to be
10:05 - doing this this one's on saturday so
10:08 - next tomorrow's saturday july 17th but a
10:11 - week from then i'll have to do the same
10:12 - thing
10:13 - and then i have the third lesson you
10:15 - know and then the third lessons q a
10:17 - also for the week following so that's a
10:19 - fair chunk of time
10:20 - and then the rest of the stuff is really
10:23 - going to be focused
10:24 - on knocking out most of the rest of the
10:26 - things that are
10:27 - bottlenecking me from finishing this
10:29 - site here the ministry website that i've
10:31 - been
10:32 - you know people who know me will know
10:33 - i've been working on this for years now
10:35 - actually
10:36 - um but one of the things that i still
10:39 - have left outstanding
10:40 - is documentation so for a long time the
10:43 - bottleneck in me getting this up has
10:44 - been me feeling like
10:46 - well actually whoops i don't have it i
10:48 - don't have it published yet it's still
10:50 - in
10:50 - dev mode well anyway i won't pull that
10:52 - up then um documentation
10:53 - on the the website theme that i've been
10:56 - running everything through
10:58 - you know basically justifying the
10:59 - reasons why i'm laying things out how i
11:01 - am
11:02 - um and basically i decided you know what
11:04 - i'm being too much of a perfectionist
11:06 - here
11:06 - i may care about why i do things but
11:09 - that doesn't necessarily mean that i
11:11 - need to write it up for the rest of the
11:12 - world
11:13 - so i've kind of given up on finishing
11:15 - all the documentation up front so what
11:17 - i've decided to do
11:18 - is be very mercenary about it and only
11:20 - pull in
11:22 - the the descriptions and the
11:23 - justification for things that
11:25 - i need to link to for people to
11:27 - understand how to use functionality
11:29 - so i'm going to have a summary page
11:30 - though i had a page on
11:34 - this site here just explaining basically
11:38 - actually i think it may still be up
11:39 - because i haven't pushed those local
11:40 - changes either um yeah this page right
11:42 - here
11:43 - that talks an awful lot about all of the
11:45 - advantages
11:46 - that this site offers from a content
11:48 - sense so you know we have
11:50 - stuff like here you know hyperlinking to
11:53 - book resources and we're talking here
11:56 - about how you can
11:57 - jump to edit all the pages straight from
11:59 - github and
12:01 - all of the the ux stuff so the user
12:03 - experience the sidebar menu
12:05 - the dynamically scrolling table of
12:07 - contents when we go here on these pages
12:09 - you'll see that we have these embedded
12:11 - windows
12:11 - that lets you have lexicons cross-linked
12:15 - and if you click on the lexicon you
12:16 - actually have a full original language
12:18 - concordance right there
12:19 - and all of this advanced stuff
12:22 - well basically a lot of that's going to
12:24 - get pulled out
12:25 - into the summary here that i'm going to
12:27 - do on my personal website which is where
12:30 - the
12:30 - project theme for this website is going
12:32 - to live or not project theme the
12:34 - project documentation for this website
12:36 - theme is going to live
12:38 - and so i'm just going to try to do the
12:39 - greatest hits not explain and justify
12:42 - everything even though i have quite a
12:43 - bit written up you know tens of pages
12:45 - probably
12:46 - about the reasoning behind all this well
12:48 - basically that doesn't have to come up
12:50 - front
12:50 - at least and that's what i finally come
12:52 - to after thinking about it for a while
12:54 - um so summarizing all of that i'm
12:57 - linking
12:58 - the more formal write-ups for the things
13:00 - that i
13:01 - do need to formally write up so the
13:03 - things that drive actual functionality
13:05 - that people
13:06 - would want to be able to click on um i'd
13:09 - say the best way of thinking this is in
13:10 - like
13:11 - self-documenting um so you can see here
13:13 - i have content lists
13:14 - and over here we have the content level
13:16 - so if something's intermediate you know
13:17 - you think beginner intermediate advanced
13:19 - it's appropriate for intermediate levels
13:21 - of readers
13:22 - well when they click on this right now
13:24 - on this page it takes me
13:26 - straight to the documentation for okay
13:28 - what what are content levels you know
13:29 - what does this mean
13:31 - so i'm going to be moving some of this
13:32 - over to the documentation of the website
13:34 - team
13:35 - and one of the reasons for this is
13:36 - because i would like to be able to
13:38 - generalize the theme so that other
13:40 - people can make use of it
13:42 - so i have two people who i know i'm
13:43 - going to be helping build websites for
13:44 - them
13:45 - and you know that is short term the
13:47 - thing because then it'll be my site plus
13:49 - two more
13:50 - plus my personal website is actually
13:51 - four websites that will be pulling from
13:53 - the same theme
13:54 - and rather than having them write a
13:57 - bunch of documentation about the same
13:58 - features that we've already implemented
14:00 - well if i'm just smart about it i can
14:02 - have all of the short codes so the
14:04 - things
14:05 - the things that automatically build the
14:07 - fancy looking features
14:09 - like these list pages you know the ones
14:10 - that you can collapse and expand and all
14:12 - that
14:13 - well i'll have these automatically
14:14 - linked to the theme documentation
14:16 - and that way all four sites that use
14:18 - these things will be able to
14:20 - instantly have that documentation at
14:21 - their fingertips so that's what i came
14:23 - to
14:23 - but i have to write up the documentation
14:25 - for that so i'm going to finish off the
14:27 - pages that are
14:28 - actually important at least so far as
14:30 - i've identified them thus far
14:31 - which is content level so that beginner
14:33 - intermediate advanced things
14:35 - um the writing level here um a couple
14:38 - big points
14:39 - uh you'll see on this page we have the
14:41 - yellow sections or side notes
14:43 - these are basically just tangentially
14:45 - tangentially related things
14:48 - and then these technical discussion
14:49 - sections so you can see here we're
14:50 - talking about a greek word
14:51 - um in some of my personal writings so
14:56 - you know this is this is my personal
14:57 - website um
14:59 - which eventually once the ministry
15:01 - website gets launched i'll come back and
15:03 - and hopefully clean this one up a lot as
15:05 - well you know i have
15:06 - uh for example stuff written here about
15:08 - nutrition
15:09 - um this was one of the things that i
15:11 - thought was high high impact high
15:13 - priority so i wrote it all up and you
15:14 - know i have
15:15 - discussion here of intermittent fasting
15:18 - and a lot of
15:19 - a lot of stuff talking about metabolism
15:21 - and all of this
15:22 - and eventually when i go back and i i
15:25 - make it
15:26 - pretty with all the content sections
15:27 - like this well some of that will
15:28 - probably end up in these
15:29 - the technical discussion sections and
15:32 - the idea behind the writing level is
15:33 - well not everyone
15:35 - you know you can think particularly
15:36 - children people without a lot of
15:38 - education
15:39 - non-native english speakers well they
15:40 - might want to just get the gist of
15:41 - things
15:42 - without having to wade through all the
15:44 - really complicated technical stuff
15:46 - and so i have this toggle that just
15:49 - boom gets rid of it gets rid of all of
15:52 - the
15:53 - uh tangential discussion because for
15:55 - example for non-native english speakers
15:57 - you know reducing the the amount of
16:00 - things they have to read will make their
16:02 - life a lot easier
16:03 - um so if they're struggling reading
16:04 - english period then reducing the amount
16:06 - that they have to read
16:08 - to you know get the content on your site
16:10 - well that's obviously a good thing and
16:11 - then the technical discussion especially
16:13 - will just take that discussion and hide
16:16 - it immediately
16:17 - on the page um so that's something i
16:19 - spent time implementing
16:21 - um but i need to document that behavior
16:23 - otherwise it just it's confusing you
16:25 - know you
16:25 - you don't see it um you know of course
16:28 - these complicated windows um are one of
16:31 - the other things that i have on the
16:32 - docket because you you look at that and
16:34 - you know if you've never seen it before
16:36 - you're like well goodness what's this
16:38 - how does this work
16:39 - you know you see i have it height
16:40 - adjustable with javascript here so
16:42 - people can let me if you're doing
16:44 - something more advanced like you're
16:45 - searching on a word you want to see all
16:47 - the lexicon entries for it
16:49 - you know you might minimize this and
16:50 - boom now you've got every place this
16:52 - word occurs
16:53 - highlighted in the entire new testament
16:55 - you know we're still in matthew mark
16:57 - luke here um anyway you know you can
17:00 - adjust the height of that and all that
17:01 - but this
17:01 - doesn't seem super intuitive or obvious
17:04 - right so i'm going to have to write all
17:05 - that up as well that's one of these
17:06 - tasks i think
17:08 - yeah where are we um short code yeah
17:11 - embedded embedded bible app iframes
17:13 - that's what these things are
17:15 - and then i've also got content level
17:17 - like i said writing level those iframes
17:19 - um i'm also going to add a link one of
17:22 - the to-do's it's not really a bug but
17:24 - you see how i've got these height
17:25 - buttons well
17:26 - i can probably just get away with the
17:27 - icon and then i'll save maybe
17:29 - 20 30 pixels just by deleting the word
17:31 - height here
17:32 - and then i can add a button over here on
17:33 - the left that basically is like what's
17:35 - this
17:35 - so someone clicks that they get taken
17:37 - directly to the documentation
17:38 - um in user interface design something
17:41 - i'm a big fan of is
17:42 - so-called like discoverability or
17:44 - self-documenting design
17:46 - where people can click on buttons and
17:48 - stuff and then
17:49 - it will automatically take them to what
17:51 - explains it um so i
17:52 - i'm a big fan of that like i said you
17:54 - know i do it here on
17:56 - no come on don't be slow on these lists
18:00 - here with these you know people click on
18:02 - the content level they automatically get
18:04 - taken to the documentation that explains
18:05 - what it is
18:06 - so i like that self-documenting design
18:09 - um
18:09 - all right well that's a lot of it you
18:11 - know that's updating the short codes
18:13 - there um
18:14 - we're also going to make all the short
18:15 - codes like i said i'm moving the
18:17 - documentation to
18:18 - the project document the project page on
18:20 - my personal website you know where i'm
18:22 - talking about the open source theme that
18:23 - i'm writing
18:25 - um and so all of the links throughout
18:27 - all of these short codes you know this
18:28 - link here
18:29 - right now so you look down at the bottom
18:31 - left of the screen you see the url it's
18:33 - pointing to this website bible docs
18:34 - which is my ministry site
18:36 - but i'm going to have that going to
18:38 - actually the theme documentation so i
18:39 - need to go update all the links for that
18:41 - that's what this task is and then only a
18:44 - couple more things in the way
18:46 - of this theme launching so getting the
18:48 - documentation there is really the big
18:50 - thing you know i do have
18:51 - some content up already i'll be writing
18:53 - more particularly once i get close to
18:55 - launching
18:56 - but once i get the documentation of
18:58 - features
18:59 - out there as it is one of the only
19:02 - things that i have left outstanding
19:04 - is a bug that i gotta fix um so i was
19:06 - looking at
19:07 - well okay i'm not on that page anymore i
19:09 - was looking at this page here talking
19:11 - about eternal rewards
19:13 - and so i was showing you the writing
19:14 - level bit right so you can see over here
19:17 - uh we have these things uh that show up
19:20 - in the table of contents that are in
19:22 - this side note section here
19:24 - but when i hide this you see how that
19:26 - still is in the table of contents
19:28 - well it turns out that right now i have
19:30 - javascript that hides it if you have a
19:31 - technical discussion section it's a
19:33 - header
19:33 - it takes it out of the table of contents
19:35 - but i have to update the jquery
19:36 - to actually remove the side note
19:38 - sections as well um these have a custom
19:40 - class that i've put on them
19:42 - um so these are one of the css classes
19:44 - like the handles like the nesting and
19:46 - stuff is called
19:47 - like special content section i think and
19:49 - then this one's got a class called
19:51 - sidenotes well
19:52 - basically you just do a jquery selector
19:54 - on
19:55 - the sidenote class and then if it's in
19:57 - this table of contents you know these
19:59 - are
19:59 - our unordered lists you know so like ul
20:03 - and li tags in html well you you go
20:05 - ahead and you hide the active ones
20:07 - which is what triggers like the nesting
20:08 - over here i don't want to get too
20:10 - technical there but
20:11 - um i the bug in this is is not like
20:14 - something is
20:15 - uh super broken that i haven't figured
20:17 - out i know what it is
20:18 - um i just have to go add the jquery
20:20 - calls to go ahead and remove the side
20:21 - notes from the table of contents when i
20:22 - re
20:23 - when i uh toggle the writing level as
20:25 - well um so that's
20:26 - basically it um once i uh
20:30 - i polished the uh summaries as well um
20:32 - so that's a big thing
20:34 - that i was aiming for you know something
20:35 - that i really wanted to see user
20:37 - experience wise is
20:38 - being able for people for people to have
20:41 - these summaries you know they can toggle
20:42 - it with the
20:43 - settings page here you know these are
20:45 - just setting cookies in the browser
20:46 - super simple
20:48 - but if they don't want to see the
20:49 - summaries they can hide the summaries on
20:51 - list pages
20:52 - and then you know they can fit a lot
20:54 - more links on the page right you know
20:55 - see that's a lot
20:56 - a lot less space taken up than when you
20:58 - show the summaries but the summaries
20:59 - in general are helpful for people
21:01 - navigating your website
21:03 - in terms of content organization so
21:06 - i need to write summaries for a couple
21:08 - things so one of the the main first
21:09 - studies i'm going to be doing is
21:11 - this one on basically it's not quite a
21:13 - christian epistemology but along those
21:15 - lines and you can see i have the full
21:16 - outline here
21:17 - um you know it doesn't look super great
21:19 - on the page right now because these are
21:21 - all like
21:22 - you know h2h3h4 tags but in the outline
21:25 - over here you see
21:26 - where the study will go eventually but
21:29 - as you see on the
21:31 - list page here for this this content
21:33 - type i haven't written a summary for
21:34 - this yet so if you
21:35 - expand it it's blank so i have a couple
21:37 - more things i got to write summaries for
21:39 - and then hopefully that's it you know i
21:41 - i've been putting a date on this a
21:44 - couple of times only to have it blown
21:45 - back because i keep coming up with stuff
21:47 - to do but
21:47 - i really am close you know i've got
21:49 - maybe two pages on the website now you
21:51 - know
21:52 - quite a few of these question and answer
21:54 - things where
21:55 - i've written up some exchanges some
21:58 - thoughts i've had on various topics you
21:59 - know this is me generating the questions
22:01 - and the answers
22:02 - this was from a while back when a friend
22:03 - asked me about a question and i was
22:05 - answering their question
22:07 - um so i do have some things up um and of
22:10 - course the videos like i mentioned
22:11 - are that that channel is gonna go become
22:14 - much more active you know i
22:16 - currently the production pace is gonna
22:18 - be about five videos a week
22:20 - um if i ever scale to do two teaching
22:22 - videos of my own a week it'll be seven
22:24 - seven videos every week uh each about 20
22:27 - to 25 minutes so you know that's quite a
22:29 - bit of content right there
22:30 - um but anyway all of this you know
22:34 - i guess off topic isn't the right word
22:36 - but you know you've seen it now
22:37 - um at some point i'll probably do a demo
22:39 - video on doing your task management in
22:41 - devops
22:42 - you know like i said i'm super biased
22:44 - because i'm a software engineer so i use
22:45 - this all the time in my day job
22:47 - which means that it's just very much how
22:48 - i like looking at the world but
22:50 - nonetheless i think it is actually super
22:52 - useful um to task things out
22:54 - and then to break them down you know
22:57 - again more software engineering things
22:58 - and
22:59 - concept of encapsulation and
23:01 - compartmentalizing the work you do
23:02 - breaking big things down into smaller
23:04 - things
23:04 - um but i found it super useful and this
23:07 - is actually gonna be my first time
23:08 - trying it out explicitly you know using
23:10 - the
23:11 - the agile software management software
23:14 - you know explicitly for my own task
23:15 - management but
23:17 - um i you know i get a bang out of it
23:19 - when i'm at work i actually
23:20 - helped schedule some of the work for my
23:22 - team now um
23:24 - but that's what i wanted to go over
23:26 - today um so again this is what i'm going
23:28 - to be doing um
23:29 - for the next couple weeks so like july
23:31 - what is it 17th to the 30th
23:33 - and you know once that time is up i will
23:36 - make another video
23:37 - for sprint review and retro talking
23:39 - about you know what i got done and
23:41 - and how it went and what i think i could
23:43 - do better in the future um and then
23:45 - i'm planning on continuing to do this
23:46 - actually so um
23:48 - it's something that helps me collect my
23:50 - thoughts you know i i plan all this out
23:52 - i
23:53 - task stuff by our stuff and at the end
23:55 - of it you know we have this burn down
23:57 - um you know i'll be able to see i'll be
24:00 - able to see
24:00 - how i did you know uh you may have seen
24:03 - these they track what's called velocity
24:05 - which is if you give effort points to
24:06 - tasks you can see
24:08 - what your relative productivity was from
24:10 - sprint to sprint
24:11 - and i'm planning on using some of these
24:13 - metrics and the nice thing about them is
24:14 - they're completely automatic
24:16 - so some of that more advanced stuff
24:18 - we'll get into um and i'll see how this
24:19 - progresses like i said you know i'm
24:20 - planning on
24:21 - putting up videos for sprint planning
24:23 - and then reviewing retro
24:25 - just to track the progress that i'm
24:26 - making and all of the tasks i do outside
24:28 - of work
24:29 - all right well i think that's it for
24:30 - this week and we'll report back in two
24:33 - weeks and see how much i actually got
24:34 - done
