00:00 - hey guys so my name is stephen tamman
00:02 - and today i'm going to be
00:04 - going over the review and the
00:06 - retrospective for
00:08 - the first sprint i had trying to
00:09 - organize some of the work
00:11 - that i do in my personal life external
00:13 - to my job
00:15 - so as you can see over the top right
00:17 - hand corner here
00:18 - on the burn down yeah well i did not
00:21 - actually end up completing
00:22 - much of the work i had tasked for myself
00:24 - in this sprint now some of that
00:26 - is just because i was bad and didn't
00:28 - drag the tasks to doing and done for
00:31 - some of these things that i actually did
00:32 - do
00:33 - uh you'll see that when i go through the
00:34 - review so i did make these videos i
00:36 - haven't
00:37 - quite finished posting the slides and
00:39 - linking them on the website and
00:40 - everything yet
00:41 - um but there were reasons for this um
00:44 - and uh before we jump into all that
00:47 - though i will start out by
00:49 - actually just reviewing what i did get
00:51 - done so
00:52 - um and there's quite a bit you can see
00:54 - the tabs up here
00:55 - in the bar we're gonna go through all of
00:57 - this hopefully
00:58 - i won't drag it out too long here but
01:02 - you know as i say this is going to be
01:04 - the time when i go over what i did do
01:06 - and then what went well and what didn't
01:08 - go so well so those are the things that
01:10 - are part of the retro
01:11 - so that in coming sprints so when i do
01:15 - this again in the future
01:16 - i will have hopefully learned something
01:18 - so that we
01:19 - do work more effectively and work better
01:22 - in the future
01:23 - so the first thing that we're going to
01:24 - talk about here are
01:27 - all of the things that i got done that i
01:28 - actually did do so even even if i didn't
01:30 - drag all the tasks here and even at the
01:32 - burn down that's not very pretty
01:33 - well i did do things so first thing i'm
01:36 - going to talk about is some of the
01:37 - videos that went up
01:38 - on the ministry youtube channel so
01:41 - um two playlists here uh the
01:45 - the study that is my own which launched
01:48 - basically
01:48 - right before we did this sprint i think
01:50 - i maybe had one video up there
01:52 - well we have six videos there now and so
01:54 - i believe it was
01:56 - videos two the question answers for two
01:58 - and three and the questions and answers
01:59 - for three that were part of this sprint
02:01 - um and so you can see all of these are
02:03 - are up there um
02:05 - you know they're anywhere from like 15
02:07 - minutes to 35 minutes or so we're trying
02:09 - to to keep the length down here so that
02:11 - they're more approachable
02:12 - um so those four were this sprint and
02:15 - then we also have
02:16 - six six videos from this sprint in the
02:20 - general bible study discussion group
02:22 - that i run
02:23 - going through this other study so 56.1
02:27 - so parts one two and three from week 56
02:29 - and then parts one two and three from
02:31 - week 57 all of those got up from this
02:34 - sprint as well
02:35 - now something of particular note on
02:37 - these from the discussion group
02:38 - is that since we don't have
02:40 - predetermined topics
02:42 - on these i actually have to go
02:45 - and build time stamps kind of by hand
02:48 - and i made the decision that just
02:51 - because they're useful
02:52 - you know i want to be able to link
02:54 - people to these
02:55 - and have them be a resource
02:59 - that are useful to others moving forward
03:02 - rather than just being a static video i
03:04 - decided to actually take my time on
03:06 - these and make sure i did it right
03:07 - as you can see here when we have the
03:09 - time stamps on these videos
03:11 - we have quite a bit of description that
03:13 - summarizes exactly what we're talking
03:15 - about at any given point in time
03:17 - um so time stamping the videos that i
03:18 - make myself are easier
03:20 - because i'm in control of the topics and
03:22 - so basically it's just
03:23 - going from slide to side and saying okay
03:25 - that's when we made the transition
03:27 - but for these uh discussions that we
03:29 - have here in our discussion group that
03:31 - are less bounded so less planned
03:34 - it's still very useful to
03:37 - make that topical outline that people
03:39 - can click to in the video so that you
03:41 - can
03:41 - link to specific topics but also here
03:44 - you can see this serves very much as a
03:46 - summary of what we actually did talk
03:47 - about so
03:48 - you know if someone doesn't want to to
03:50 - go through this entire
03:52 - video that's more than 30 minutes well
03:53 - if they read this they read
03:55 - the time stamps and then they read the
03:57 - general summary well they'll have a
03:58 - pretty good idea of what it is we talked
04:00 - about
04:01 - so it's kind of like the sparknets
04:02 - version if you will
04:04 - all right so that's not right there what
04:06 - i just showed so that's four videos six
04:08 - videos that's ten videos
04:10 - um that is actually the production pace
04:13 - of what will be put up every spring so
04:16 - every two weeks
04:17 - there will be ten new videos put up on
04:19 - this youtube channel
04:20 - um so it's five videos a week and i'll
04:22 - get back into the time breakdown of that
04:24 - a little bit more
04:25 - uh once we get into the retro part of
04:27 - this so of course all of this took
04:30 - time you know this was a a larger time
04:32 - expenditure over these last two weeks
04:34 - um i also put some videos up on my
04:36 - personal youtube channel so that's the
04:38 - one that
04:39 - this video itself will actually get
04:40 - posted to i mean none of this stuff was
04:42 - actually planned
04:43 - and in fact as you'll see that's one of
04:45 - the reasons why i didn't
04:46 - necessarily get so much work done on
04:49 - that task breakdown itself
04:50 - is because a lot of the stuff i did do
04:52 - well i hadn't really accounted for it
04:54 - this is normal even when you use agile
04:57 - uh
04:57 - planning it work i mean you try to
04:58 - minimize it you try to minimize
05:01 - so-called scope creep or you know
05:04 - diverging from the plan you make but you
05:06 - know since this is just
05:07 - me organizing my work personally if i
05:10 - don't stick to this
05:11 - nothing really bad happens you know i'm
05:12 - not trying to chain myself down in any
05:15 - way
05:16 - um so a long way of saying i i've made
05:18 - some videos here on my personal youtube
05:20 - channel as well
05:21 - um so one of them was
05:24 - describing the amazon purchase i'd made
05:26 - you know all of the stuff i bought
05:28 - you know i had reasoning for it you can
05:30 - see here i have direct links to all the
05:31 - products and then
05:32 - all of the many links i had um
05:35 - from the research i did now i actually
05:38 - ended up returning the bike lock just
05:39 - because
05:40 - well you know i've been sort of
05:41 - dithering about biking to work for a
05:42 - while
05:43 - um and and just decided you know i don't
05:45 - have to make the decision right now but
05:46 - other than that
05:47 - have everything it all came um so that
05:49 - was a video but you know doing all the
05:52 - description there and all the research
05:53 - that took a while
05:54 - and then another video um i had to
05:57 - update the
05:58 - uh the build image so the build servers
06:02 - for netlify which is where i host my
06:04 - websites
06:05 - are using uh the lts versions of ubuntu
06:09 - and they were recommending that we bump
06:11 - our our
06:12 - our build image version there so i made
06:14 - a tutorial because some other people on
06:16 - the support forums weren't
06:18 - having the easiest time understanding it
06:20 - um so you know that's another thing i
06:21 - did
06:22 - then i made another video this one's
06:24 - sort of off the cuff i just decided you
06:25 - know what
06:26 - i was thinking about how to do stuff
06:28 - with transcripts from youtube videos
06:30 - um you know still thinking about the
06:31 - structure of the videos a little bit and
06:34 - so i did a video
06:35 - going over cleaning up
06:38 - some of the transcripts you can copy
06:41 - paste off of youtube
06:43 - using regular expressions and then also
06:45 - how you build
06:46 - how you build in a spreadsheet program
06:49 - how you can build
06:51 - you know time stamps with links so if
06:53 - you want to copy all those into an html
06:55 - file you can actually link
06:57 - directly to each and every time stamp
06:59 - using
07:00 - youtube's ability to link to specific
07:02 - times in the video um so that's another
07:04 - thing that i just
07:04 - i mean i did it wasn't necessarily
07:06 - something i planned
07:08 - and so i actually ended up cleaning it
07:10 - up so more than what's in that video um
07:12 - that video was kind of me just doing it
07:14 - back at the napkin you know kind of off
07:15 - the cuff as i was just doing it live
07:18 - well i actually cleaned it all up and
07:19 - made a formal spreadsheet for this
07:21 - so um if i
07:25 - come down here and cut all this you'll
07:26 - see that the the formulas will
07:28 - update there um well
07:32 - so you can see this is you know how many
07:34 - lines uh
07:36 - almost 2 000 lines of timestamps from
07:39 - this video that was maybe oh i don't
07:40 - know half hour long
07:42 - and so we have these formulas here that
07:43 - are actually picking up
07:45 - the times in the videos you can see it's
07:47 - an offset formula
07:49 - using some some uh math here
07:52 - to get the correct times and so this is
07:55 - picking up
07:56 - every other every other row for over
07:58 - here
07:59 - the times and this is picking up every
08:01 - other row offset by one
08:03 - to pick up the actual time stamps and
08:04 - then we do some math to get
08:07 - the minutes and seconds in just an
08:09 - integer number of seconds which is what
08:11 - you feed
08:12 - into it's what you feed into the youtube
08:15 - url
08:16 - up here right you give it something in
08:18 - the query string you do like
08:20 - you know the question mark to denote the
08:22 - query string and then you say t
08:24 - equals some integer number of seconds
08:26 - well that's how you link to a specific
08:28 - time in the youtube video so we build
08:29 - all these links
08:30 - and then you can copy you can copy paste
08:33 - these into an html file
08:35 - to let your readers do that um and that
08:37 - has some advantages
08:39 - over the transcript that
08:43 - you can pull up on youtube like this um
08:45 - so this is great because it lets you
08:46 - link to like specific parts of the video
08:48 - um and it syncs with the video but if
08:50 - you ever want to do like find and
08:52 - replace or you want to do anything more
08:53 - complicated
08:54 - well then having it on a separate page
08:56 - actually kind of makes sense so
08:58 - again all of these things are things
09:00 - that i hadn't actually tasked out in the
09:01 - sprint but that i ended up doing
09:03 - nonetheless all right so along those
09:07 - lines
09:07 - here's something that was actually
09:08 - tasked in the sprint and i i did get a
09:10 - start on it so this was writing up the
09:12 - index page for the documentation of
09:15 - the website theme here we go this one um
09:18 - and so as you see i mean
09:20 - you see the scroll bar over here i did
09:21 - get a reasonably good start on this
09:23 - i'm going to have to keep going though
09:25 - because you know i did kind of get
09:27 - inundated with other things and so
09:29 - i mean the other thing is i want to make
09:30 - sure i do it right you know i don't want
09:32 - to
09:33 - be shortchanging myself just because i
09:35 - had a task here with only
09:36 - thus and so many hours and if if it
09:39 - grows in scope it grows in scope
09:40 - right i mean i kind of a perfectionist
09:42 - so i want to make sure that i do a good
09:44 - job but
09:44 - this actually didn't end up getting all
09:46 - that much time for me because you know
09:48 - i was figuring out all the video stuff
09:50 - still and you know doing those other
09:52 - unplanned videos and
09:54 - um but this is something that i'll keep
09:55 - doing next sprint
09:57 - you know all of the all of the project
10:00 - stuff so all the things relating to the
10:01 - website itself all of those tasks are
10:03 - really going to roll
10:04 - over i mean you know they'll probably
10:05 - keep rolling over i don't even know if
10:06 - i'll get to them all next friend they'll
10:08 - keep rolling over until i actually do
10:09 - them
10:10 - but you know the point of this i'm going
10:12 - to keep coming back to this is that it's
10:14 - trying to help me organize
10:16 - organize the work i have so even if i
10:18 - don't stick with it well
10:19 - if it served its use then i'm not gonna
10:21 - be too sad about it
10:22 - um now here is the single biggest thing
10:26 - that
10:27 - sucked time away from what i would have
10:30 - otherwise been doing that was unplanned
10:32 - so the very first week that we were
10:35 - doing
10:35 - this split out format in our general
10:38 - discussion group
10:39 - one of the people on our discussion
10:40 - group i don't know if there was some
10:42 - settings with his computer he was just a
10:44 - little bit far away from his mic but he
10:45 - was really quiet on the recording
10:47 - and i am not a quiet person so i was
10:50 - very loud on the recording
10:52 - and so that wasn't going to be good you
10:54 - know people who were listening to the
10:56 - recording with their headphones
10:57 - would go from you know stephen talking
10:59 - very loud to
11:00 - my friend talking much more quietly and
11:02 - that that was not going to be acceptable
11:04 - and so i needed to figure out a way to
11:06 - clean up the audio to get it so that the
11:08 - volume
11:09 - of people on the same audio call were
11:12 - leveled out um so i had to do a lot of
11:15 - research here um i actually hadn't
11:17 - had too much audio experience i mean i
11:18 - knew a little bit um you know because i
11:20 - had
11:21 - used a condenser microphone when i was
11:23 - holding an in-person bible study a few
11:25 - years back
11:26 - you know i mean you see i wrote all that
11:27 - up i actually had written most of that
11:29 - beforehand but hadn't actually ever
11:31 - posted it
11:32 - um but you know i had to do a lot of
11:34 - research to figure out how to do this um
11:36 - their so-called
11:37 - audio normalization which uh
11:40 - makes you can change the overall volume
11:42 - of an audio recording um as it's encoded
11:45 - um and dynamic range compression which
11:47 - reduces the
11:48 - the peaks and valleys and loudness
11:50 - basically but i ended up actually going
11:52 - with
11:52 - what's called a dynamic normalizer um
11:55 - and so there's some some very smart
11:57 - people who wrote these
11:59 - algorithms to do this sort of
12:00 - normalization on audio files
12:03 - and so it uses something called um
12:06 - gaussian smoothing
12:08 - to even out the jumps and audio so as
12:11 - you go from local peaks
12:12 - and you have these changes in loudness
12:14 - it kind of smooths it all out
12:16 - but the basic idea i mean not to get too
12:19 - often the wheats here
12:20 - is that what it will do is it will take
12:23 - an audio file where you have unequal
12:25 - speakers so me who's very loud and my
12:27 - friend who is very quiet
12:29 - and it will kind of make everything more
12:31 - like the same
12:32 - level while preserving the emphasis that
12:35 - we have in our speech
12:36 - so if you just make everything the same
12:37 - level period well what happens if
12:39 - someone is trying to make a point
12:40 - so they talk slightly louder for a
12:42 - second well you want to preserve that
12:43 - um so there's like i said some very
12:45 - smart people wrote audio solutions to do
12:47 - that
12:48 - but all of this stuff like i had almost
12:50 - no knowledge going into this so i had to
12:52 - do a lot a lot a lot of research
12:54 - before i felt comfortable that i was
12:55 - doing the right thing
12:57 - and then it came out so almost the
12:59 - entire first weekend
13:01 - that i was doing the video stuff
13:04 - i had to research this to make sure that
13:06 - i was doing what i wanted to
13:07 - um and so there you go uh anyone who's
13:10 - watching this who just wants to know
13:11 - what's the answer well that's that's
13:13 - what i decided on using a filter
13:15 - the dynamic audio normalization as a
13:17 - filter in the ffmpeg program
13:20 - to clean up the audio of the mp4
13:23 - files okay so that took i mean i don't i
13:26 - don't i never tracked it but
13:28 - i would guess more than 12 hours of me
13:29 - doing all the research and writing
13:31 - everything up
13:32 - making sure i understood it um now i
13:35 - also am using this other command line
13:37 - program to automatically remove silence
13:39 - from the videos
13:40 - and you know this was something i was
13:42 - doing even before we came into this
13:43 - sprint
13:44 - but uh something that was causing some
13:46 - pain was that well by default this
13:48 - program
13:49 - actually doesn't compress the videos so
13:51 - how it works at a high level
13:53 - is it for each and every frame of the
13:55 - video
13:56 - um zoom which is how i'm recording
13:59 - things records at a static
14:01 - flat 25 frames per second so for each of
14:04 - the 25 frames in a second
14:06 - um this program actually checks if
14:08 - there's audio going along with those
14:10 - frames
14:11 - and there's a threshold so if you have a
14:14 - you know a certain number of frames that
14:15 - have passed without any audio then it
14:18 - will actually remove those frames so it
14:19 - removes silence
14:20 - you can see you can actually set the
14:21 - number of frames here and depending on
14:24 - your frame rate that actually
14:25 - corresponds to a different number of
14:26 - time
14:27 - so i like i said i'm recording at 25
14:29 - frames per second if someone's recording
14:31 - at 60 frames per second well then
14:33 - they're gonna have to set a bigger frame
14:34 - margin to get the same effect but
14:36 - at any rate it automatically removes
14:37 - silence from videos but it was
14:39 - not compressing the videos as it did
14:41 - this because it was basically
14:42 - concatenating together
14:44 - all of the frames using ffmpeg on the
14:47 - back end
14:48 - but it wasn't compressing anything and
14:49 - so i had to figure out how you get it to
14:51 - this is using the h.264 video codec
14:55 - and i'm using a compression factor of
14:57 - about 30. it ranges from like one to
15:00 - it's like 51 or something so this is
15:02 - basically
15:03 - how how how much you sacrifice the
15:06 - quality
15:07 - as trading off in video compression size
15:10 - so previously when i was doing this um
15:13 - the videos that
15:14 - i was uploading to youtube were ending
15:16 - up being like two or three gigabytes
15:17 - because
15:18 - it wasn't compressing the video so i had
15:20 - to figure out how to compress it and
15:21 - it doesn't sound so hard but figuring
15:24 - out exactly what
15:25 - uh flags i had to use in this command
15:27 - actually took me a long time especially
15:28 - since
15:30 - not how i would design my command line
15:32 - program but you actually have to use
15:33 - like this thing here before you use
15:35 - these options it's called like an
15:37 - option group i think um and that
15:39 - confused me because the documentation
15:41 - wasn't
15:42 - it's not that it was bad but um it
15:44 - wasn't immediately obvious
15:45 - you know for for me as a neophyte here
15:48 - to figure out how to
15:49 - run the command how i wanted it to um so
15:52 - you know all that aside i also spent
15:54 - some time seeing if i could do
15:56 - filtering based on movement um so the
16:00 - package i'm using here is called auto
16:02 - editor you know i do very much like it i
16:03 - think it's a very
16:04 - a very awesome pack i mean you can see
16:06 - the whole point here is that you don't
16:08 - actually have to sit there and manually
16:09 - edit your files the computer does it for
16:11 - you
16:11 - right but one of the things that
16:13 - actually supports is using motion
16:14 - detection
16:15 - so if you are silent in your video and
16:18 - the mouse isn't moving
16:19 - then maybe you want to cut that but
16:21 - maybe if you're shooting a screencast a
16:23 - tutorial on something where you're not
16:24 - talking but you want your mouse
16:26 - to show up on the screen well how do you
16:27 - do that um so it has
16:29 - you know these these flags here and you
16:32 - can do audio or motion audio and motion
16:34 - and even
16:35 - you know exclusive or and stuff like
16:37 - that let me see there's some handy-dandy
16:39 - pictures here
16:40 - but so i was going to try to set this up
16:41 - just to see um
16:43 - if it was something i might want to do
16:44 - or tutorials and stuff now for
16:47 - teaching recordings where you're going
16:48 - through a slideshow you know like over
16:49 - here well
16:50 - you don't really need the mouse that
16:52 - much for this as long as you set up
16:54 - takes you know like static static frames
16:57 - on the page
16:59 - intelligently you don't really need to
17:01 - be able to capture mouse movement
17:02 - without audio
17:03 - but if you're ever doing a screencast
17:05 - tutorial maybe that's a good thing
17:07 - however the problem with recording with
17:10 - most
17:10 - audio or with most video software is
17:13 - that it records in a lossy format
17:15 - so mp4 is is lossy
17:19 - so zoom in particular you know i'm doing
17:21 - a compressed mp4
17:22 - so you actually have all of these small
17:24 - pixel changes when you compress
17:26 - the format because as things change
17:28 - you're not guaranteed to have exactly
17:30 - the same
17:31 - pixels across the entire screen and so i
17:33 - had a conversation with one of the guys
17:35 - on the discord server
17:37 - uh that supports this this video
17:39 - application
17:40 - you know sort of saying hey you know i
17:41 - was trying to use the movement based
17:43 - flags and it didn't seem to be working
17:45 - and you know what am i doing wrong
17:46 - stuff like that um and so we were
17:48 - talking and it sounds like one way that
17:51 - you might be able to get around this is
17:52 - to
17:53 - use lossless screen recording software
17:55 - so you record files
17:57 - without any compression without any
17:59 - wassiness
18:00 - and then that will let you perhaps
18:03 - better evaluate the movement commands
18:04 - now at this point i was like okay that's
18:07 - that's a little bit too hardcore
18:08 - i don't really need this behavior but
18:10 - i'm just bringing it up because
18:12 - for some people who do screencast
18:14 - tutorials you know step by step where
18:16 - they want to show their mouse movement
18:18 - but they don't want to have to talk 24 7
18:20 - while they're moving their mouse you
18:21 - know something that's more of like a
18:23 - demo
18:23 - rather than a presentation then figuring
18:26 - this out might be worth it um
18:28 - i mean these are some messy errors there
18:30 - and i took it took a while to figure out
18:32 - that that was
18:33 - essentially what i'd have to do all
18:35 - right so i don't want to get
18:36 - any more off in the weeds there than i
18:37 - already have um the other thing um this
18:39 - is sort of a sneak preview of something
18:41 - that's going to come in the future for
18:42 - me
18:42 - is i was doing research on gopros action
18:45 - cameras in general
18:46 - i have a lot of products that you know i
18:49 - want to kind of review
18:50 - in in person you know i need i need a
18:52 - camera shot to take this and
18:54 - i'd always been meaning to do the
18:56 - research here but never gotten around to
18:57 - it so i was researching
18:59 - how to get good point of view footage um
19:01 - and also how to
19:02 - clean up your footage from gopros um you
19:05 - know those
19:06 - gopros have excellent image
19:08 - stabilization but the colors and the
19:10 - contrast
19:10 - the default settings aren't so great out
19:12 - of the box and so there's this guy who
19:14 - runs
19:14 - a mountain biking channel that i follow
19:16 - who he and his wife i think were like
19:18 - professional
19:19 - videographers or at any rate they know a
19:21 - lot about photography
19:22 - and so they have this video i don't
19:25 - really need to show it i guess actually
19:26 - on how to set up your gopro
19:27 - and so i've done a bunch of research
19:29 - here in preparation for doing that
19:31 - uh in the future and i don't know
19:32 - exactly when that will be but
19:34 - you know that was research you know
19:35 - several hours of research at least there
19:38 - okay almost done just a couple more
19:40 - things that happened this sprint so
19:42 - another one
19:42 - was just uh using a spreadsheet here to
19:46 - track
19:46 - some of the uh or just some of the
19:49 - fiction that i've
19:50 - you know consumed over the years um i'd
19:52 - always meant to organize things like
19:53 - this before
19:54 - um and something that i wanted to do was
19:56 - to be able to dynamically sort by
19:59 - different genres and stuff so just
20:01 - keeping a a library here you can see i
20:03 - just gave some examples and i'm not
20:04 - gonna
20:05 - show you my actual watch list here but
20:06 - you know sort by medium so if it's anime
20:09 - or just a normal movie or whatever
20:11 - um let's say i wanted to find a movie
20:14 - that had the genres of action and then
20:18 - like do i have one for sci-fi maybe no
20:22 - action and let's say like fantasy
20:25 - so fantasy and action well you can
20:27 - actually sort by multiple things until
20:29 - you get
20:30 - whatever whatever combination of these
20:32 - flags you want so you can see here
20:33 - here are some of the the genres and you
20:35 - can of course define your own
20:36 - um it's not it's not super hard to uh
20:39 - set this up if you have any experience
20:41 - in excel you know i worked
20:43 - for a while for a consulting firm in
20:45 - atlanta when i had an internship in
20:46 - college so i'm pretty comfortable
20:48 - in spreadsheet programs and it's really
20:50 - helped a lot because something like this
20:52 - is kind of
20:53 - like if you were to throw a full
20:54 - programming language at it it's kind of
20:56 - overkill
20:56 - like you could maybe you'd have a little
20:58 - bit better user interface but i set this
21:00 - up in maybe 20 minutes or something
21:02 - whereas if you were to code out a
21:04 - computer program for it it would take
21:05 - you
21:06 - quite a bit longer than that um so this
21:08 - is just something and i was messing
21:09 - around with
21:10 - to organize some of that and then
21:12 - finally
21:13 - last thing that i i spent some time on
21:15 - this sprint i mean actually this hasn't
21:17 - been even completely exhausted this is
21:18 - probably just the greatest hit version
21:20 - but
21:20 - um i helped i helped a friend set up a
21:23 - website um he
21:24 - is launching a technical writing
21:26 - business and um
21:28 - you know just i helped do some of the
21:29 - design work here on the
21:31 - the uh uh you know the text box here and
21:34 - the background images and you know i
21:36 - think it came out pretty well
21:38 - um he had uh another set of
21:40 - acquaintances we have that were helping
21:42 - him with the dns and the hosting and
21:43 - stuff
21:44 - but um i did do some of the design work
21:46 - here and so
21:47 - you know that was even more unplanned
21:49 - time in the sprint here
21:51 - all right well that's just at a very
21:53 - high level uh many of the things that
21:55 - i've been working on the last couple
21:56 - weeks
21:57 - um you know there's there's probably
21:59 - even more than that but
22:00 - um you know that's just at least a an
22:02 - idea of it so
22:04 - um i'm going to go ahead now
22:07 - and oopsies um
22:11 - i mean to do that go ahead now and
22:14 - go over some of the actual retro stuff
22:16 - so we just went over all the things i
22:18 - did you know that's the sprint review
22:19 - you know what did you do does it
22:21 - function um now we're going to go over
22:23 - the retro stuff so what went well and
22:24 - what didn't go so well
22:26 - so always best practice to start with
22:28 - what went well
22:29 - at least that's what we do at work in
22:31 - retros um so
22:33 - as you can see i did get a fair bit done
22:35 - in the last two weeks um so this is
22:37 - two weeks since i posted the sprint
22:39 - planning video and i'm gonna post
22:40 - another sprint planning video
22:42 - today um but in these two weeks
22:45 - well i got all that stuff done um but
22:48 - of course here you can see that as i've
22:51 - been
22:51 - saying repeatedly throughout here the
22:54 - fact that
22:55 - my burn down looks like that which is
22:57 - not
22:58 - much of a burn down um well that fact
23:01 - isn't going to trouble me overly here
23:03 - um just because of the purpose that i'm
23:05 - using this for
23:06 - is as an organization tool for myself
23:09 - rather than
23:11 - you know an agenda not to be disobeyed
23:13 - um
23:14 - however with the understanding that if
23:16 - you're trying to get an understanding of
23:17 - how agile is supposed to work
23:19 - from these videos that i'm doing yeah do
23:21 - as i say not as i do
23:23 - um because if i were to have a burn down
23:25 - like that for
23:27 - my team at work you know the team that i
23:28 - helped coordinate work for in our in our
23:31 - sprint planning and stuff
23:32 - i would 100 be exiled from running
23:34 - sprints because that's not a good burn
23:35 - down at all
23:36 - um but anyhow um you know as we see here
23:41 - you know i did i did get quite a bit of
23:42 - stuff done
23:43 - um and it will always sort of be a
23:44 - balance i think figuring out how much i
23:47 - want to lock myself into following
23:49 - the plan versus how much i just kind of
23:52 - you know do things off the cuff or as
23:54 - they come up
23:55 - um you know i think there's a balance to
23:57 - be drawn here if i have actual deadlines
23:59 - well and then i'm sure i'll stick to the
24:00 - tasks more
24:02 - but some of this will just depend on
24:04 - circumstances as well and so that's why
24:06 - i'm not overly worried about you know my
24:08 - my failure to complete everything i had
24:10 - planned because well if i didn't finish
24:12 - it i can just move it into the next
24:13 - sprint
24:14 - so what didn't go so well well as you
24:15 - see i didn't i didn't really even come
24:17 - close to finishing
24:18 - any of the work um so the task work
24:21 - relating especially to the ministry
24:22 - website kind of got pushed back a little
24:24 - bit as i focused on the videos more
24:26 - um and the other thing here was that my
24:28 - time budgeting wasn't super accurate you
24:30 - know how long it would take
24:31 - maybe that's not immediately evident
24:33 - because i really didn't burn a lot of
24:35 - the hours here
24:35 - but um the time estimations weren't so
24:38 - great on the videos
24:39 - i mean i'll get into that you know in a
24:41 - couple slides here
24:42 - um but these were the things well
24:45 - basically as as a
24:46 - as a sprint you know as a development
24:48 - organization sprint yeah i
24:49 - did not do so great um on this one
24:53 - but i like i said i there are some
24:54 - reasons for this um so we've talked
24:56 - about many of them as
24:57 - i went through the review here you know
24:59 - here's that here's the audio thing i was
25:01 - mentioning about you know that was
25:03 - a couple days on the very first weekend
25:05 - here that i spent doing that
25:07 - i also mentioned trying to figure out
25:08 - how to get the
25:10 - videos to get properly compressed when
25:12 - you remove the command line tool to
25:13 - remove silence on them
25:15 - so that we're compressing with that
25:17 - h.264 audio codec
25:19 - rather than uncompressed so that when i
25:21 - upload to youtube it takes you know
25:22 - five minutes rather than an hour i also
25:26 - worked them overtime
25:26 - in my job during the last couple weeks
25:29 - not a lot but some
25:30 - i helped my friend set up his business
25:32 - website right this one here
25:34 - that i helped do some of the design on
25:36 - um oops
25:38 - and then here's where i was getting at
25:40 - some of the the tasking stuff on the
25:42 - videos um so devops
25:43 - this interface that i was talking up as
25:46 - you know being a great way to organize
25:47 - your work even
25:48 - even external to your job right this
25:50 - agile workflow
25:52 - that way of looking at things well you
25:54 - can set your capacity for yourself
25:56 - uh day by day right so you see i set my
25:58 - capacity here two hours a day
26:00 - well the problem is is that it doesn't
26:01 - let you it doesn't let you set capacity
26:05 - differently for different days and so
26:07 - why that's important for me
26:08 - is because because i work at nine to
26:10 - five monday through friday i don't have
26:12 - nearly as much time on weekdays as i do
26:14 - on weekends
26:15 - and so what would be nice is if i could
26:17 - set you know my weekend capacity on
26:19 - saturday and sunday to be something a
26:20 - lot higher
26:21 - you know maybe like eight hours a day
26:23 - versus my weekday capacity of two hours
26:25 - a day
26:26 - which would average out to give me a
26:27 - daily capacity quite a bit higher than
26:29 - just two hours a day
26:31 - so what i had done initially was
26:33 - thinking you know what i'm going to be
26:34 - doing a lot of video stuff on the
26:35 - weekend so maybe i just won't task those
26:37 - things out i'll just know that i'm going
26:38 - to have to do them and i'll just task
26:39 - out the other stuff that i want to get
26:40 - done
26:41 - but that ended up not really tracking
26:43 - the work very effectively and so what
26:45 - i'm going to be doing moving forward
26:47 - is just going to be tasking myself
26:49 - higher
26:50 - every day even though i know that if i
26:53 - task myself
26:53 - it four hours a day so four times seven
26:56 - is about 30 hours a week you know it's
26:58 - 28 hours a week
26:59 - um well i won't actually be able to work
27:01 - four hours on weekdays because i'll have
27:03 - too much other stuff i'm doing so maybe
27:05 - maybe max two hours two and a half hours
27:06 - on weekdays but then
27:08 - all of that other time will get spent on
27:11 - saturday and sunday when i have more
27:12 - time on the weekends
27:13 - so just so that i can have have the
27:15 - capacity in the sprints here
27:17 - um so i look at the task board i believe
27:20 - i believe that i'm only tested
27:22 - well i don't remember exactly how much
27:24 - but you know what
27:25 - two hours times uh 14 days so i think 28
27:29 - hours total here
27:31 - versus i could probably almost double
27:33 - that if i counted all the weekend time
27:35 - so you know more like 56 hours in the
27:36 - sprint
27:37 - um so that's what i'm going to be doing
27:38 - i'm going to be tasking it
27:40 - you know with higher hours every day
27:42 - with the understanding that i won't
27:44 - actually be able to
27:45 - sink those hours in on weekdays but i'll
27:47 - make up for the the loss on weekends
27:49 - um so on the off chance that a microsoft
27:51 - person actually ever sees this video
27:54 - it would be really really nice in our
27:56 - interface here if you could have
27:58 - different people having different
28:00 - capacities so like
28:01 - setting different capacities per day per
28:03 - person because that would let
28:05 - at least the use case that i'm trying to
28:06 - use devops for and i mean i
28:08 - googled around and saw on the internet
28:10 - other people had similar requests
28:11 - you know so what happens if you know you
28:14 - have an intern who only works
28:16 - you know maybe three hours every couple
28:18 - days of the week and then goes to his
28:19 - classes on his other day
28:21 - on his other days because he's working
28:23 - part-time while also being a student
28:24 - well then he doesn't have capacity every
28:26 - day he only has capacity some days of
28:28 - the week
28:28 - and so the ability to set different
28:31 - capacities
28:32 - per day per person in any team in devops
28:35 - would be super useful all right so
28:40 - given that one of the biggest failings
28:41 - here was not being able to track the
28:43 - video time very effectively well now
28:45 - that i've done it for two weeks
28:46 - i think i have a better idea of how the
28:48 - time breaks down here
28:49 - so for my videos and my videos being um
28:53 - oh come on load uh being these here
28:56 - so the uh the satan's world system that
28:59 - video series that we're going through
29:01 - here
29:01 - well since i'm the one in control of
29:03 - those topics it's a lot easier for me to
29:05 - timestamp these videos so
29:07 - to timestamp and write summaries and
29:09 - titles and everything for them in
29:10 - probably less than 30 minutes 30 minutes
29:11 - is probably a bit conservative
29:13 - um but i do have to prepare more because
29:16 - you know this is this is me teaching
29:18 - it's not so discussion focused it's very
29:20 - much
29:21 - you know me going through the the
29:24 - material that i've organized and
29:25 - prepared
29:26 - and so you know total for two videos a
29:28 - week
29:29 - we're looking at probably under five
29:30 - hours but not too much under it's a four
29:32 - and a half maybe so
29:34 - maybe three hours of preparation an hour
29:35 - to actually record the videos and then
29:38 - 30 minutes to do the time stamps and
29:39 - summaries and stuff
29:41 - now the thing that is an even bigger
29:43 - time sync is when we're doing
29:44 - our discussion group video so thus far
29:47 - we're we're doing about three of those a
29:49 - week so each video under 30 minutes or
29:51 - so
29:51 - well i still have to do some preparation
29:53 - to get stuff in the slide format you
29:55 - know like even as we're using
29:57 - same slide format here right so that
29:59 - takes some time
30:00 - and then holding the videos actually
30:02 - takes a good bit of time because
30:04 - well if we're being honest you know we
30:05 - have a meeting time but people usually
30:07 - trickle in a little
30:08 - bit and we talk casually before and
30:10 - after we actually roll the formal
30:12 - recordings
30:13 - so call that three hours for the whole
30:14 - meeting uh you know an hour and a half
30:17 - of preparation
30:18 - and then time stamping these at least
30:20 - doing it in the detail that i want to
30:22 - um so we we showed here that um
30:26 - in this in in the time stamps for these
30:29 - videos
30:30 - um you know if i go click on one and we
30:33 - we go look at the timestamps and the
30:35 - description
30:36 - you know i showed how detailed they were
30:37 - while doing that properly actually takes
30:40 - a fair bit of time and so maybe
30:43 - wait for that to load i don't know
30:45 - what's being so slow um
30:47 - but you know getting the time stamps and
30:50 - then
30:50 - writing the summaries on top of the time
30:52 - stamps maybe takes
30:54 - you know maybe it takes two and a half
30:55 - hours or something along those lines and
30:57 - so the total time expenditure here we're
30:59 - looking
31:00 - really more at like seven hours a week
31:02 - to get the three
31:04 - videos for our discussion um
31:07 - all right so there's the video um
31:11 - and in any case um
31:15 - so all together we're looking at
31:16 - probably something like 11 hours a week
31:18 - just to do the videos for this bible
31:20 - study channel
31:21 - um so that's you know five videos a week
31:24 - ten videos
31:25 - every sprint um and so breaking out in
31:28 - about
31:28 - two hours of video and that's including
31:30 - all preparation all time stamping all
31:32 - summaries and organization and stuff
31:34 - plus
31:35 - actually in video production spheres
31:37 - that's not bad at all
31:38 - um but i'm not doing any manual editing
31:41 - so editing out takes or whatever i'm
31:42 - doing everything automatically
31:44 - you know with the removal of silence and
31:46 - all that um but
31:48 - still given that i have a full-time
31:50 - nine-to-five i'm still
31:51 - starting out above 50 hours a week of
31:53 - time commitment
31:54 - and that's actually not counting my
31:56 - commute so if you come up count my
31:57 - commute
31:57 - you know depending how many days i tell
31:59 - work a week it's even quite a bit higher
32:01 - than this
32:01 - and then on top of that i cook and i i
32:04 - work out
32:05 - and all this other stuff so you know i
32:07 - mean you see how
32:08 - you know it's not like i have just
32:10 - oodles of free time
32:11 - anyway um so that's the retro here
32:15 - you know we we talked about here how you
32:17 - know there's some
32:18 - some reasons why i didn't end up having
32:20 - a very pretty burn down this time
32:22 - um and perhaps some of that will be
32:23 - better in the future but um
32:26 - at the same time you know we're not
32:28 - going to tie ourselves so formally to
32:30 - this
32:30 - that we get all disturbed by the fact
32:32 - that you know it wasn't so perfect
32:34 - because again this is just a tool for me
32:36 - personally to organize all the work i'm
32:38 - doing
32:40 - all right well i think that's going to
32:41 - be it for this video um another video
32:43 - that i'll probably post today as well is
32:44 - going to be the sprint planning video
32:46 - for the next print which
32:47 - honestly i think will be a lot shorter
32:48 - than the last one because it's basically
32:50 - going to be like hey we're still going
32:51 - to do all these things that we made
32:52 - tasks for but we didn't do
32:54 - so but that will be in the next video um
32:57 - and this video was just
32:58 - talking about the uh sprint review so
33:01 - what i did
33:02 - and the retro regarding that so thanks
33:05 - for watching
33:06 - and maybe you can check out the video
33:08 - for the next sprint
