### Sprint 1 review and retro

---

#### Review

- Show all the things

---

#### Retro

- What went well?
- What didn't go so well?

---

#### What went well

- I got a lot of stuff done the last couple of weeks, even if I didn't follow the plan so well.
- This task management planning is supposed to help structure and organize my work, not be *An Agenda Not To Be Disobeyed*, a chain around my ankle. So I'm really not too bothered by the flat burndown. (Although if I let my team at work have a such a burndown... I would be exiled from running sprints!)

---

#### What didn't go so well?

- I didn't even come close to finishing the tasked work relating to the ministry website launch! Most of it will roll over.
- The time budgeting was... not so accurate. Part of this is that I had a hard time estimating the time it would take to do everything for the videos due to not having done it all before.

---

#### Steven's excuses

- I spent a good 12+ hours learning about and writing up audio stuff, to make sure the audio in the videos will always come out well. (The Week 56 videos had me very loud, and Odii very soft -- I needed to fix that).
- I spent probably several hours figuring out how to get the videos to come out properly compressed when running the silence-removing tool on them. (So that I'm not uploading things that are Gigabytes to YouTube, but things that are instead  much smaller).
- I worked some overtime at work during this sprint. Not much, but a little.
- I helped a friend set up his business website. I only helped a bit (mostly frontend design stuff) -- and some other folks helped set up DNS and hosting and such -- but it was still some unplanned time.
- I left some of the tasking off the videos (such as the time for actually holding the meetings themselves) due to not being able to choose capacity on a per-day basis in DevOps. I work a 9-to-5 Monday through Friday, but have much more time on weekends. What would be nice is to have the option then to give myself more capacity on Saturday and Sunday, and less during the week, rather than only being locked to one number.
   - On the off-chance a relevant Microsoft person ever sees this: pretty please let us have different capacities per day per person?
   - What I will be doing moving forward is just setting the per-day capacity higher, with the understanding that I probably won't do much more than 2.5 hours a day of personal work on weekdays, but a lot more on weekends.

#### Time breakdown for my own videos

2 videos/week: my own video lessons and Q&As = ~4.5 hours/week

- Most of the time is up-front in my own preparation. Call it 3 hours of preparation total, if we're being optimistic.
- Holding the videos: ~1 hour total, across both.
- Timestamping and summarizing the videos is easy since the topics are pre-determined. Call it 30 minutes total.

---

#### Time breakdown for videos for our free-ranging discussion group

3 videos/week: videos from our free-ranging discussion group = ~7 hours/week

- I still have to do some prep time up-front to get content in slides for  us to discuss. Call it 1.5 hour of preparation total, if we're being optimistic.
- Holding the videos: ~3 hours total. (People never really arrive on time, and we also stick around to talk casually after the recording stops).
- Timestamping and summarizing the videos -- particularly if I aim to give a good, through description of all we talked about -- takes a decidedly long time. For 3 videos totaling 1.5 hours of runtime, my experience thus far has been that it takes around 2 hours to get detailed, broken-down timestamps, with a bit more time on top of that for writing the summaries proper. Call it ~2.5 hours total.

#### Time breakdown for all videos together

Thus, we're talking over 11 hours/week just to do the videos for my Bible Study channel. At a bit over 2 hours/video of my own time, that's not terrible, but this is meaning that, with my job, I'm starting out at 51 hours/week of time commitment right up front. (More than that actually, if you count commute times).
