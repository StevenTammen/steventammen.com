00:00 - hey guys what is up my name is stephen
00:02 - tamman and today i'm going to be talking
00:04 - about
00:05 - the amazon order that i'm going to be
00:07 - placing um so
00:09 - in the last video that i made talking
00:11 - about the
00:12 - organization of things i'm going to be
00:14 - doing the next couple weeks
00:15 - i said that i was going to just go ahead
00:17 - and
00:18 - every time i make an amazon order or do
00:21 - anything like that i'm going to try to
00:24 - just make a quick video summarizing the
00:26 - thoughts off the top of my head
00:28 - as to why i'm doing the things i'm doing
00:30 - um so some of this is for me
00:32 - so i can come back later and reference
00:34 - these things you know if i get asked
00:36 - about it or
00:37 - you know someone asks hey you know you
00:38 - got that thing why'd you get this one
00:40 - over that one
00:41 - or what was your thought process or
00:42 - something i can just be like here go
00:44 - look at this
00:45 - but some of it also is just for me
00:47 - personally
00:48 - so that i can remember you know in a
00:50 - year's time you know why did i buy that
00:52 - thing
00:52 - did i have good reasons for it and then
00:54 - of course making myself do this
00:56 - also restrains any sort of impulse
00:59 - buying because
01:00 - well i'm just forcing myself to think
01:01 - things through a little um so you'll get
01:03 - a snapshot of my process
01:05 - you know i i do tend to be a pretty
01:06 - research heavy person
01:08 - um so you know as you see up here in the
01:11 - browser there's quite a few links and
01:13 - this was just me
01:14 - you know over the last oh i don't know
01:16 - maybe 30 40 minutes
01:18 - uh just compiling the research that i
01:20 - knew i needed to do
01:21 - to make the decisions that i'm going to
01:22 - go through today so i'm just going to go
01:24 - in order this will probably be pretty
01:25 - rapid fire here but
01:26 - you know it's probably the best way for
01:28 - me to do this and then i will try to
01:30 - post links down
01:31 - in the description of this video of the
01:33 - things that i actually did decide on
01:35 - so the first thing i want to talk about
01:37 - is these things the flushable
01:40 - wet wipes so i was reading an
01:42 - interesting article
01:43 - um about this company in the uk that
01:46 - actually makes wet wipes that are safe
01:48 - to flush
01:49 - now you know i i knew this from
01:52 - experience that if you look on the backs
01:54 - of
01:54 - many wet wipes you know like the ones
01:55 - that you get to oh i don't know
01:59 - clean your hands before you eat or
02:00 - things like that many of them have
02:02 - polypropylene in them which is a form of
02:04 - plastic and they don't biodegrade
02:07 - and so there's actually been a huge huge
02:09 - issue with consumers flushing these down
02:12 - the plumbing systems in urban areas and
02:15 - you get these things called fatbergs
02:18 - and so i have this wikipedia article
02:19 - about these things pulled up right here
02:21 - and uh
02:22 - you know there's been a few of these in
02:24 - big urban areas you know like i think
02:26 - wet wipes you know i don't quote me on
02:28 - this but i think they may be
02:30 - more common in the uk than in the united
02:32 - states because you can see
02:34 - many of these many of these examples
02:36 - that show up on the wikipedia page of
02:38 - london
02:39 - um or you know chelsea and then
02:41 - melbourne australia
02:43 - um wales mid whales i think that's the
02:46 - uk
02:47 - but anyway it seems like they just may
02:49 - have you know statistically more people
02:51 - may use them there
02:52 - but i was intrigued in the concept just
02:54 - because you know in terms of personal
02:55 - hygiene i think they make a lot of sense
02:57 - um however doing my research i was
03:00 - having a hard time
03:01 - coming up with things that have like
03:03 - independent third-party verification of
03:05 - yes when you flush this down the toilet
03:07 - you're not gonna you're not gonna
03:08 - contribute to creating one of these
03:10 - uh in your urban area because it turns
03:13 - out that a lot of
03:14 - uh the manufacturers of these
03:18 - well they are incentivized to a profit
03:20 - and making
03:22 - making wet wipes that hold together uh
03:24 - so that don't fall apart
03:26 - upon use is harder than it sounds with
03:28 - just normal natural materials and so if
03:30 - you
03:30 - stick a bit of plastic fibers in them
03:32 - well they hold together
03:34 - but the problem is they hold together
03:35 - for decades even
03:38 - because the plastic doesn't it doesn't
03:41 - degrade as organic you know natural
03:43 - plant-based materials do
03:45 - but it's also stronger more rigid which
03:47 - means it plugs drains easier
03:49 - um it gets stuck in pipes easier so at
03:52 - any rate
03:53 - the manufacturing companies for the
03:55 - products are not highly incentivized
03:57 - to make the wipes easy to degrade
03:59 - because basically it's not their problem
04:01 - um now the people whose problem it is
04:04 - are the
04:04 - like the water companies the people who
04:06 - have to maintain the
04:08 - plumbing systems in these urban areas
04:11 - and so a whole big coalition of them
04:13 - i mean so the the manufacturing
04:15 - companies have their interest groups and
04:16 - their lobbyists who go
04:17 - pressure politicians and such and so do
04:20 - the water people
04:20 - and so what i was trying to find is hey
04:23 - is there a wet wipe that the water
04:24 - people can get behind
04:26 - because they're the ones you know that's
04:28 - that's good you know from a
04:29 - consumer standpoint they're the ones who
04:31 - are going to be skeptical of these
04:33 - products and so if you can find
04:34 - a group of them that get behind a
04:35 - product then you can be more confident
04:37 - that that product actually does what
04:38 - it's saying it's going to do
04:40 - um you know marketing aside because a
04:42 - whole bunch of companies market their
04:43 - wipes as flushable
04:45 - but sure you can flush them down the
04:47 - toilet but the problem is if you're
04:48 - creating
04:49 - this huge environmental mess by doing so
04:51 - then in my opinion
04:53 - that's not really flushable and so if
04:54 - they don't regulate
04:56 - that word uh by regulating like the
04:59 - the government agencies who might say
05:01 - you know like that's dishonest marketing
05:02 - or you know like it must meet certain
05:05 - standards if that's not the case
05:07 - then companies will just slap it on
05:08 - everything because you know sounds good
05:10 - right um but i was trying to do my
05:12 - research to make sure i'm not
05:13 - contributing to this issue here
05:15 - and so there's this brand in the uk you
05:17 - know uh
05:18 - nature care safe to flush whatever um
05:21 - that
05:22 - well just as i said was actually backed
05:25 - by
05:25 - water uk i think this is like one of the
05:27 - uh coalitions of
05:29 - actually i don't want to just make
05:31 - things up but i mean you can read on
05:32 - this page
05:33 - um it you know they are one of the water
05:37 - groups not one of the
05:38 - uh wipes manufacturers and they got
05:41 - behind these
05:42 - saying that yay verily they actually do
05:44 - degrade and they don't
05:46 - lead to the plugs that other things do
05:48 - so there's a very long rambly way of
05:50 - saying that
05:50 - i was going to buy wet wipes and try
05:53 - them out
05:54 - but i wanted to make sure i wasn't you
05:56 - know messing with the environment
05:58 - or causing these big blockages for the
06:00 - plumbing systems
06:02 - now this is a good example of why i
06:03 - don't lock myself into just amazon
06:05 - so i am an amazon prime subscriber um
06:08 - you know i do buy
06:09 - tons of stuff on amazon it's probably
06:10 - where i shop most uh just side note here
06:13 - i don't want to get super distracted but
06:14 - one of the reasons why i do this is
06:16 - because i can sit in my pajamas like i
06:18 - am this morning
06:19 - and just google hey i want to buy this
06:21 - thing and then
06:22 - a minute later i've got a bunch of
06:24 - results and you can sort by
06:26 - reviews and number of stars and i can
06:28 - read what other people say right in
06:30 - front of me
06:31 - i have all this feedback as a consumer
06:33 - that you don't get in a store if you're
06:35 - just looking at products
06:36 - and the other big huge time saving thing
06:38 - that you get
06:39 - is that i can do it instantly um i can
06:42 - search for a product using the power of
06:45 - google or just amazon's normal search
06:46 - bar
06:47 - and i find it in what three four seconds
06:50 - and then
06:50 - two days later it magically shows up on
06:52 - my doorstep versus
06:54 - me having to go walk through a store to
06:56 - find something and it's not that i'm
06:57 - terribly directionally challenged but
06:59 - you know you have to look at the signs
07:00 - in the store and
07:01 - sometimes what you would think would end
07:04 - up in one section just because of
07:05 - whatever reason ends up in a different
07:07 - section
07:07 - so you know you might think oh it'd be
07:09 - in the outdoors section and then you go
07:10 - look for like a hose or something and
07:12 - oh well it turns out it was in like the
07:14 - automotive section because people use
07:15 - hoses when they wash their car and so
07:17 - someone thought that was logical but if
07:18 - it's not what you thought was logical
07:20 - suddenly now you've wasted 15 minutes
07:22 - trying to go find the blasted hose in
07:23 - the store
07:24 - whereas if you shop online all of that
07:26 - goes away
07:27 - anyway anyway so to pull back to this
07:29 - you can see that
07:30 - well unfortunately they don't have a i
07:33 - don't want to go buy
07:34 - 16 packs of these things before i'm sure
07:36 - that they actually work well and that
07:38 - it's a worthy investment and stuff
07:39 - um you know that's just risk management
07:41 - on my part you know it sounds good you
07:42 - know i have
07:43 - you know good logic good reasons why i
07:45 - want to do these over others right but
07:47 - i'd rather try a pack first before i go
07:49 - spend you know 60 bucks versus like five
07:52 - um but unfortunately the options here on
07:55 - amazon
07:56 - well one of them i could get for like
07:58 - five bucks but then i have to pay
08:00 - shipping and the other one with free
08:01 - shipping is like ten dollars for
08:03 - a pack of 30 which is not great you know
08:05 - like that's how much it is per 100
08:07 - um so yeah that's not so good um so
08:10 - you know i live in the southeast which
08:11 - means kroger's around and
08:13 - well guess what i just googled um so
08:17 - shippers that i think can compete with
08:19 - amazon you know i'm a big fan of
08:20 - competition in the open market
08:22 - walmart has gotten their shipping
08:24 - infrastructure quite a bit better
08:26 - recently
08:26 - so that they have pretty competitive
08:28 - two-day shipping with amazon on many
08:30 - things
08:30 - and kroger is not too bad either you
08:32 - know any of these big
08:33 - companies that have uh you know sort of
08:36 - deep pockets
08:37 - and uh wide logistics chains
08:40 - but they do shipping pretty well um so
08:42 - it turns out that kroger has these
08:44 - things
08:44 - and so this is probably where i'm
08:45 - actually gonna end up buying so i know i
08:47 - said amazon order for this video but
08:48 - well there you go i don't buy everything
08:50 - on amazon so i bought stuff off
08:52 - walmart's website and off target
08:53 - target's website as well
08:55 - um just kind of whatever happens to have
08:57 - the items i want
08:58 - you know cheaper or in stock because
09:00 - sometimes stuff runs out of stock on one
09:02 - of them um
09:03 - so that's just a quick note about not
09:05 - getting wedded to any one of them see
09:07 - much better prices here and i still got
09:09 - to pay shipping but it's like
09:10 - i don't know like three bucks or four
09:12 - bucks or something um so there you go
09:14 - um that's the wet wipe so that's the
09:15 - first thing we're going to talk about um
09:18 - next and you'll see this is going to
09:20 - seem kind of i don't know like
09:21 - completely 80d
09:22 - like none of these things are very
09:24 - related to each other but this is what i
09:25 - meant by
09:26 - i let things pile up uh so that i order
09:29 - everything at once um so it you know you
09:32 - could
09:32 - see i don't like wait to get similar
09:34 - collections of things this is just
09:35 - everything i'm buying
09:37 - you know for that i've had on my list
09:39 - for maybe a month now month and a half
09:41 - so everything gets bundled together and
09:42 - so sometimes you'll have rather strange
09:45 - neighbors in your orders so like you see
09:46 - here i'm buying wet wipes but then i'm
09:48 - buying protein powder you know those
09:50 - things don't really go together right
09:52 - but so this is whey protein powder i
09:54 - have been buying
09:56 - micellar casein from this particular
09:58 - optimum nutrition is pretty well
10:00 - regarded in the supplements community
10:02 - um really one of the reasons why i'm
10:05 - buying them is because if you you can
10:06 - compare
10:07 - things by price i actually didn't pull
10:08 - up that because i knew i wanted to buy
10:09 - this specifically
10:10 - this brand but normally i do a bunch of
10:12 - research um you know like i just pull up
10:14 - the protein powders page on amazon and
10:16 - like okay how expensive is this one
10:17 - relative to this one
10:18 - and what's the quality like and one of
10:20 - the big reasons here
10:22 - again not to get off in too big a
10:23 - tangent why i'm going with this brand is
10:24 - just look at the number of reviews that
10:26 - they have here
10:27 - i mean and so you don't just want to
10:29 - look at stars because if you have
10:32 - five star reviews but there's only like
10:33 - three of them that's not a good sample
10:35 - size statistically
10:36 - um but there's a hundred and somewhat
10:39 - thousand reviews here
10:40 - for this particular brand of protein
10:42 - powder and most of them are positive
10:44 - so as a rule of thumb i'd say if you
10:46 - have a couple thousand you know
10:48 - at least more than a thousand reviews
10:50 - that are all greater than four stars
10:51 - that product is likely to be good um now
10:54 - if they're all
10:55 - you know if you have a high enough
10:57 - sample size of reviews and it's closer
10:59 - to five stars and that product is likely
11:00 - to be very good
11:01 - right i mean this is just heuristics
11:02 - rule of thumb sometimes people might
11:04 - jump on the bandwagon
11:06 - and they'll all say this thing is is
11:07 - great but maybe it's not maybe
11:09 - maybe it's great for what those people
11:10 - bought it for but maybe it's not great
11:12 - for you
11:12 - so you do have to think a little bit but
11:14 - this is the power of amazon this is why
11:16 - i love
11:16 - amazon i mean not so much as a company i
11:19 - mean not that i think they're
11:20 - particularly terrible but just because
11:22 - of the platform of what they give to us
11:23 - as consumers
11:24 - is that i can using these heuristics of
11:27 - the stars and the ratings
11:29 - i can make snap judgments it takes a lot
11:31 - of the decision time off of me
11:32 - because other people have already done
11:34 - it so all i have to do is go look and
11:36 - compare and
11:37 - on their on their market page and just
11:40 - go look
11:40 - at the options that are out there in the
11:42 - product space and then
11:43 - pick the one that has the best ratings
11:45 - and the best stars you know that meets
11:47 - my needs
11:48 - um so it makes decisions very easy
11:49 - anyway all that aside
11:51 - um i decided i wanted to buy whey
11:53 - protein powder um so casein is what i
11:56 - have been using
11:57 - um now i'm gonna be a little bit hand
11:58 - wavy here but casein takes a long time
12:00 - to digest so both of these are dairy
12:02 - proteins
12:03 - um but casein like i said being hand
12:06 - wave it kind of congeals a little bit
12:08 - and it you digest it slowly so the
12:10 - benefit of this and why i initially got
12:12 - it because i thought
12:13 - well i don't know i i didn't come across
12:15 - a lot of very good like double-blind
12:16 - peer-reviewed scientific studies on this
12:18 - concept but it makes logical sense to me
12:20 - so if we say that casein takes a long
12:22 - time to digest and it's a slow digesting
12:24 - protein
12:25 - then that would tend to make you think
12:26 - that it keeps you full longer right
12:28 - and so one of the whole shticks of the
12:29 - nutrition thing that i've been trying
12:31 - is i've been trying to eat a lot of
12:32 - protein and a lot of fiber
12:35 - so that i stay full for longer and i
12:37 - just end up eating less calories overall
12:39 - right so losing weight is primarily
12:41 - about sustaining a calorie deficit
12:44 - and if you have things that make you
12:45 - feel full but don't net more calories
12:47 - well that's a good way to make a calorie
12:48 - deficit right
12:49 - so that's why i've done casein in
12:51 - particular
12:52 - um but i've started weightlifting i mean
12:55 - not necessarily in the last month or
12:56 - whatever you know i've been doing it a
12:57 - while now
12:58 - but what way has i mean you can see i
13:00 - pulled up the page i like this side of
13:02 - fair bit health line
13:03 - um you know i find it reasonably
13:05 - unbiased you know they they try to quote
13:07 - science and
13:08 - i don't think they have too terribly
13:09 - much of an industry lobby
13:11 - like influencing what they write but you
13:13 - know they have pretty good introductory
13:14 - pages about
13:15 - you know types of proteins and
13:17 - macronutrients and
13:18 - even other things like supplements and
13:20 - stuff so health wine is what i'm looking
13:22 - at here but
13:23 - you know whey protein is very much
13:24 - something that weight lifters do you
13:26 - know bodybuilders that sort of thing
13:28 - um and the reason for that is because
13:29 - whey is very high in these things here
13:31 - branch chain amino acids particularly
13:33 - leucine which is one of these you know i
13:35 - think it's leucine isoleucine and valine
13:38 - but when you build muscle you know
13:40 - protein
13:41 - is always said to be important for
13:42 - building muscle but actually in
13:43 - particular it's these things the
13:45 - branched chain amino acids
13:46 - um so proteins are made up of amino
13:48 - acids so different kinds of protein have
13:50 - different profiles of them
13:52 - but whey is actually very high in these
13:54 - now you can buy
13:55 - branched chain amino acid supplements
13:57 - all on their own but those things are
13:58 - actually like per ounce they're super
14:00 - expensive
14:01 - um and the science isn't particularly
14:02 - great on oh yes
14:04 - if you just use branched chain amino
14:05 - acids you're gonna build so much more
14:07 - muscle
14:07 - at least to my knowledge i hope i'm not
14:09 - wrong here um but based on the studies
14:11 - i've seen
14:11 - once you get enough of these like you do
14:13 - need a certain threshold
14:15 - to get enough of these but once you have
14:16 - enough then it's mostly overall protein
14:19 - that drives muscle uh growth muscle and
14:22 - anabolism um but anyway because whey is
14:26 - high in these
14:27 - you can make sure that you're going to
14:28 - get enough of these
14:30 - especially on lifting days so the
14:32 - general plan that i'm
14:34 - thinking i'm going to follow here is on
14:36 - days when i'm not lifting weights
14:37 - so you know i maybe do three times a
14:39 - week you know bench squat deadlift
14:40 - that sort of thing um well on those days
14:43 - i'll
14:44 - drink you know away milkshake uh
14:47 - after those because that has all of the
14:50 - protein
14:51 - that's fast absorbing um and that has
14:54 - all these
14:54 - branched chain amino acids and then on
14:56 - other days where i'm just trying to eat
14:57 - less calories overall
14:58 - you know to sustain that calorie deficit
15:01 - well that's when i'll have the casein to
15:02 - keep myself full longer
15:04 - so again i don't know how much science
15:06 - you can actually find
15:07 - behind this i did look because like i
15:09 - said it makes good intuitive sense to me
15:11 - but
15:11 - i don't think i could actually find a
15:12 - lot of studies that said
15:14 - oh yes um exactly exactly what steven's
15:17 - thinking here yes we have data that
15:18 - supports that but
15:20 - nonetheless that's what i'm planning on
15:22 - doing um oh and i suppose when i should
15:24 - say i should say milkshake
15:25 - um i am mixing these things with one
15:27 - percent milk so
15:28 - i just don't like skim milk very well um
15:30 - i i don't
15:32 - i kind of want to enjoy how these things
15:34 - taste and i i'm
15:35 - reasonably fond of um the the uh
15:38 - the taste of these from optimum
15:40 - nutrition i believe they have
15:42 - yeah it looks like they have um where's
15:45 - the sweetener
15:46 - uh whatever um i think they have some
15:48 - form of sweetening
15:49 - in them um because they taste pretty
15:51 - good you know not perhaps quite as great
15:52 - as like
15:53 - you know if you go to a fast food place
15:55 - and you get like a chocolate smoothie
15:56 - but
15:57 - not too far off that either and so i
15:59 - don't find i have to like
16:00 - choke them down or anything i actually
16:02 - enjoy how they taste if i use one
16:03 - percent or two percent milk
16:05 - um skim milk to me or just water i mean
16:07 - you can drink it with just water but i
16:09 - mean i don't think it tastes quite as
16:10 - good so that's why i do one percent milk
16:12 - you know which is
16:13 - reasonably good you know high protein
16:15 - and carbs you lower fat
16:16 - um even in just in the one percent is
16:18 - pretty good all right so that's
16:20 - the protein powder um like i said you
16:22 - know these products are not related
16:24 - um so i sprayed my wrist pretty good
16:26 - mountain biking oh i don't know several
16:28 - months ago now
16:29 - um not because i like fell off my bike
16:31 - and ran into a tree or anything but just
16:32 - because i had a pretty big bump
16:34 - and my bike doesn't have full suspension
16:37 - now that's something else you know a
16:39 - topic for a different time i am planning
16:41 - on getting
16:42 - a bike with full suspension eventually
16:43 - when i go mountain biking but
16:45 - um i jarred my wrist pretty good and it
16:47 - was pretty sore for a couple weeks after
16:49 - that
16:49 - um so i was looking at wrist guards now
16:52 - i have wrist guards that i got for
16:53 - sprained wrists
16:54 - you know earlier um these here you know
16:56 - uh mine
16:57 - it's good for what a wrist guard does
16:59 - you know like it keeps your wrist
17:00 - relatively immobilized and helps it heal
17:02 - and recover and stuff but
17:04 - the problem is i don't know if you can
17:05 - see it from this picture it like
17:06 - overlaps your palm
17:08 - right so if you ever want to pick
17:09 - something up when you've got the wrist
17:10 - guard on
17:11 - and for me specifically if i want to
17:13 - grab my handle bars when i've got the
17:14 - wrist guard on
17:15 - on my bike it just gets in the way um so
17:19 - i looked and did a bunch of research and
17:21 - you know this is used by
17:23 - not just mountain bikers but also by
17:24 - people who do like motocross
17:27 - um these wrist guards here this picture
17:30 - doesn't
17:31 - no i could go find morris pose but these
17:33 - things are pretty cool because
17:34 - they do immobilize your wrist you know
17:36 - on the uh up and down vertical and
17:38 - lateral planes
17:40 - however they keep your palm completely
17:41 - free um i actually have
17:43 - gel gloves as well for reducing like
17:46 - impact
17:46 - uh on my palms so you know they have
17:48 - they have five millimeter
17:50 - gel on the palms or so that i'm going to
17:52 - try to wear under these as well
17:54 - to help reduce some of the the general
17:56 - forces going into my hands
17:58 - um from the mountain bike you know so i
18:00 - don't get shaken to death um but i was
18:02 - really interested in this
18:03 - um it's got like a boa system here so
18:06 - that's how you tighten it
18:07 - um but this immobilizes your wrist you
18:11 - know so prevents the over extension that
18:13 - leads to sprained wrists
18:14 - you know it's progressive as well so the
18:16 - tension ratchets up as you
18:18 - try to move your wrist more and more out
18:20 - of position which means you know you
18:22 - still have a little bit of give and
18:23 - flexibility which is what you want when
18:24 - you're mountain biking
18:26 - um but while still leaving your palm
18:29 - completely free to grab things um so
18:32 - mountain biking and also just biking to
18:34 - work you know i am planning on trying
18:35 - that soon
18:36 - um i don't know about all days a week
18:39 - but at least sometimes
18:40 - um so if you fall off a bike and you're
18:42 - going 25 miles an hour well you can hurt
18:44 - your wrist pretty good too
18:46 - um you know i'm a computer programmer by
18:48 - my day you know i'm a software engineer
18:50 - and so i really don't want to break my
18:51 - risk because that's my job
18:53 - you know i have to type and so i'm kind
18:56 - of
18:56 - paranoid about it honestly um maybe not
18:59 - quite to the degree that pianists are
19:00 - but you know
19:01 - over along those lines and so that's one
19:03 - of the reasons why i would got very
19:05 - interested in these
19:06 - now incidentally this is going to seem
19:07 - completely random but i'm also
19:08 - interested in using these
19:10 - when i do weightlifting stuff so i do
19:13 - use easy curl bars when i'm doing like
19:15 - tricep extensions and bicep curls but
19:17 - sometimes i still find that i have some
19:19 - wrist pain um
19:21 - just because when i'm closer to muscle
19:24 - failure and some of the sets
19:26 - i you know i don't even want to say my
19:27 - form is terrible it's just that like
19:29 - the the once you fatigue the muscle
19:32 - groups other muscle groups will get
19:34 - um activated they'll pick up the slack
19:37 - basically
19:38 - and so i do find that sometimes my
19:39 - wrists ache a little bit um when i'm
19:41 - doing weight lifting
19:42 - i'm not so much deadlift squat but more
19:44 - like the the ancillary exercises so
19:46 - maybe rose
19:47 - or curls or tricep extensions um
19:50 - and so i'm going to try wearing these
19:51 - when i lift as well and the reason why i
19:53 - can do that like i said and what i've
19:55 - been harping on here is because
19:56 - this particular kind of wrist guard lets
19:59 - you have your palms completely free you
20:01 - know so it wraps around the back of your
20:02 - hand
20:03 - um which means that i'll still be able
20:04 - to grip stuff and that's
20:06 - the key bit here also for the
20:08 - weightlifting um so
20:10 - along with the the sort of thing i
20:11 - mentioned initially with these how i
20:13 - wasn't just gonna go buy you know get
20:15 - the prime shipping and buy the pack of
20:16 - 16 of these because that's kind of risky
20:18 - for me
20:19 - well i do believe everything i've just
20:21 - said about these you know and i watch
20:23 - reviews and i don't usually buy anything
20:25 - without finding some you know seemingly
20:28 - reputable people who think it's a good
20:29 - idea who recommend it you know watch the
20:31 - reviews read on the forums all that
20:32 - stuff already did that for this so i
20:34 - guess i didn't pull that up in this
20:35 - video but
20:36 - um you know some some good you know
20:38 - solid mountain biking channels have
20:39 - reviewed them and you know it's not it's
20:41 - not like
20:41 - a product without reviews that no one's
20:44 - ever done before
20:44 - um but i i think the reasoning is pretty
20:46 - good here but you know i've still kind
20:48 - of
20:48 - yet to test it completely um all right
20:51 - so i knew i had the train of thought
20:52 - what i was gonna say
20:53 - was that um just how i'm not buying a
20:55 - whole bunch of these at once to reduce
20:57 - my risk in this
20:58 - so too i'm only gonna buy one of these
21:00 - even though if i like it even though
21:02 - they are either quite expensive as you
21:03 - see um
21:05 - you know what's more expensive is
21:07 - breaking your wrist
21:08 - um so that's my logic here um i don't
21:11 - know maybe maybe people will think
21:12 - they're too expensive in that but
21:14 - um i'm only going to start with one to
21:17 - make sure i like it
21:18 - because if i don't like it well then i'm
21:19 - only out you know less money than if i
21:22 - sprung for both before being sure
21:23 - because i can always buy another one
21:25 - after i determine if it's a good fit for
21:27 - me or not
21:28 - all right so that's the second one um
21:29 - you know there's the old one that
21:31 - can get replaced so then i did mention
21:33 - biking to work
21:34 - and so this is the thing that i did the
21:35 - most research on here um
21:37 - so i do have the bike that i have now is
21:40 - not particularly cheap you know it's not
21:42 - like a beater 400 500 bike it's
21:44 - something that i
21:44 - definitely want to protect and lock up
21:47 - now i'm fortunate in that i work on an
21:48 - air force base
21:49 - so when i'm on base i mean i'm still
21:51 - going to lock my bike
21:52 - but like general theft you know think
21:55 - like in the middle of new york city
21:56 - not going to happen when you're on an
21:58 - air force base where you have to show id
22:00 - even to get on base
22:01 - um so that comforts me a little bit but
22:03 - i still want to get a good bike lock
22:05 - um and i already knew what i wanted
22:07 - coming into this pretty well because i'd
22:08 - already done research on this
22:09 - i decided i wanted a u-lock so you can
22:13 - get
22:13 - i don't know if i have this the page
22:15 - pulled up anymore um you know i did my
22:16 - research i don't have all the pages up
22:18 - here
22:18 - um you can't actually get various types
22:21 - of locks that
22:22 - are uh not you know this standard shape
22:25 - that you might be expecting when you
22:26 - think bike locks you can get
22:27 - uh one that you kind of wear like a belt
22:30 - uh
22:30 - it's not is rigid you know it's flexible
22:33 - and one cool thing about that is it
22:34 - actually lets you lock your bike to like
22:35 - lampposts and trees and stuff
22:37 - rather than just legit bike racks i'm
22:40 - actually
22:40 - planning on locking my bike to a fence
22:43 - um right
22:44 - not a fence it's like the the side rails
22:46 - to the the ramp that leads up to my
22:47 - building
22:48 - um just because you know it's bike
22:50 - rack-esque um you know you can't you
22:52 - can't remove it either um but
22:54 - it would be cool to just be able to lock
22:56 - it to anything around you know like a
22:58 - lamppost or a tree or something like i
22:59 - said so that's a benefit of
23:01 - the flexible ones but the downside is is
23:03 - well they're not quite as secure as you
23:05 - know
23:06 - 15 plus millimeters of hardened steel
23:08 - right um
23:10 - so i decided i wanted a u-lock you know
23:12 - when i'm riding
23:13 - to work i need to bring my lunch and my
23:15 - gym clothes and
23:17 - my laptop on some days if i'm coming
23:18 - home to telework so i need a backpack or
23:21 - panniers anyway
23:22 - now long term i'm probably gonna get a
23:24 - rear rack on my bike
23:25 - to put panniers on it but short term i
23:27 - have a backpack backpacks are cheap
23:29 - so i already gonna have to be carrying
23:31 - something so the fact that
23:32 - these u-locks are harder to transport
23:34 - and they weigh three or four pounds
23:35 - doesn't
23:36 - i mean it's not great but it doesn't
23:37 - phase me all that much so
23:40 - i guess a long way of saying that i was
23:42 - interested here in u-lock specifically i
23:44 - already knew that i wanted the high
23:45 - security option
23:46 - you can also get bike chains um this
23:49 - same brand here that makes the the new
23:51 - york
23:51 - bike locks like this they also make a
23:53 - chain i think it's called like the
23:54 - forget about it chain
23:56 - uh but that thing weighs like six pounds
23:58 - or something it's absolutely massive
24:00 - and really the only way you're gonna get
24:02 - through this
24:03 - is with an angle grinder and the only
24:05 - way you're going to get through the
24:05 - chains with an angle grinder too
24:07 - so if i can get a lock that has roughly
24:10 - the same security but weighs like half
24:11 - as much
24:12 - well that's why i'm doing the u-lock
24:13 - rather than the big burly chain
24:15 - but again chain has similar advantages
24:17 - to the flexible ones that i was talking
24:18 - about earlier and that you can lock it
24:20 - to more things
24:21 - so anyway i decided up front that i
24:23 - wanted a u-lock then and so then the
24:25 - question was you know i
24:26 - always like i said i never just buy
24:27 - stuff i never buy the first thing i
24:29 - always go and do at least a
24:31 - 5-10 minute google search where i go you
24:33 - know like best bike lock
24:34 - and you know you want to make sure that
24:36 - you're going to a site that is
24:38 - third party you know a third-party
24:39 - reviewer that's legit um so you know i
24:42 - mean i have no idea
24:43 - the general usefulness of this site um
24:46 - i've used bicycling.com you know this is
24:47 - one of the big bike magazines you know
24:49 - they're more likely to be
24:50 - impartial you know they have a lot of
24:52 - professional writers here who this is
24:54 - their job you know they're
24:55 - avid cyclists they know what they're
24:56 - talking about basically um so you see
24:58 - this this brand gets mentioned
25:00 - all over the place they're one of the
25:01 - big the big brands um
25:04 - and they make this series called the new
25:05 - york locks you know new york manhattan
25:07 - specifically
25:08 - famous for getting bikes stolen um so
25:10 - this came up a couple of times and so
25:12 - then i
25:12 - went and found them on amazon so here's
25:14 - one that is a
25:16 - longer you know it's got a 10 inches but
25:18 - it's also heavier because of that
25:19 - and then there's the standard one that's
25:21 - more like eight inches internal there's
25:23 - that one and then one of the reviews on
25:26 - this one so i always go through and read
25:27 - the reviews um you know
25:28 - the good and the bad both um many of the
25:31 - bad reviews
25:32 - some of them i don't want to say you can
25:33 - ignore but it kind of depends
25:36 - um you have to look at the circumstances
25:38 - on it but one of the reviews here i said
25:40 - was this guy
25:40 - comparing and contrasting this lock with
25:44 - the i don't know if i'm saying this
25:45 - brand name abus i think they're a german
25:47 - brand um so they're famous for making a
25:49 - folding lock
25:49 - i didn't really want the folding lock
25:51 - because i don't think it's quite as
25:52 - secure as these so i knew i wanted
25:53 - a u-lock um but this is the sort of
25:57 - amazon comment right here
25:58 - so shout out to this guy here who these
26:01 - are the kind of reviews that are super
26:03 - helpful
26:03 - where you're finding someone who is in a
26:05 - similar position as you who
26:07 - is making a choice and they say you know
26:09 - what i'm not sure so let me go test the
26:11 - products
26:11 - right informal off the cuff maybe not as
26:14 - is
26:14 - is rigid a testing structure as like
26:17 - professional testers
26:18 - um so actually while i'm thinking about
26:20 - this let me
26:21 - let me go give a plug out to a website
26:23 - here if you've ever heard of this
26:24 - website here
26:25 - um i think it's run by the new york
26:27 - times but wire cutter
26:29 - the website here they do pretty good
26:32 - reviews on a whole bunch of stuff you
26:34 - know i
26:34 - i can think of actually while i'm on the
26:36 - topic
26:38 - um i believe this site as well is
26:40 - another one that i used a lot i use this
26:41 - when i bought my tv
26:43 - i have a 65 inch 4k tv with low input
26:45 - lag
26:46 - that i use as my monitor actually um and
26:48 - i did research here and it was great
26:50 - because they have like a
26:51 - super i mean like your best smart tvs
26:53 - like super in-depth
26:55 - like they hit all of the all of the
26:58 - the variables and they weight them and
26:59 - they give you like the best if you're
27:01 - looking for cheap the best if you're
27:02 - looking for high performance or whatever
27:04 - um so these are two sites that i can
27:05 - recommend just for general stuff but
27:08 - like i said i also pulled up the
27:10 - bicycling.com site here for
27:12 - when i was starting this and you know i
27:14 - mostly i just type it into google and
27:15 - make sure i'm reading from a reputable
27:17 - place
27:17 - um so anyway long story short i
27:20 - you know found this guy's review and i
27:22 - said okay awesome this guy thinks that
27:23 - these two
27:24 - are good bike locks so let me compare
27:26 - and contrast those i went and found the
27:27 - lock he mentioned here
27:28 - from this brand and you can see it's
27:30 - comparable price wise 119
27:32 - versus 129 um and then what i wanted to
27:35 - do was say okay so i found
27:37 - two two u-locks in the sample space how
27:40 - are these brands you know are there
27:41 - other brands considered better than
27:42 - these how do these brands stack up
27:44 - comparing to each other so that's where
27:46 - i went after this in my research
27:48 - and um i found this and then i don't
27:50 - know you can kind of tell if it looks
27:51 - like
27:52 - a site trying to sell you stuff i'm not
27:54 - saying the site is
27:55 - um you know it's informational they've
27:57 - got this this um
27:59 - i don't know uh you know what let me
28:01 - scratch that thought i think this site's
28:03 - fine um it's a comparison but i wanted
28:04 - to find more
28:05 - um and then i came across this i think i
28:07 - found this one before actually i was
28:09 - i i like this one a lot um because they
28:11 - talk about testing processes and stuff
28:13 - you know the third party
28:16 - i don't think companies quite the right
28:17 - word but like the people who test bike
28:19 - locks basically who have
28:21 - like rating systems and stuff um and so
28:24 - he's comparing and contrasting the
28:25 - brands right these are the three biggest
28:27 - bike lock brands in the world so cool
28:29 - in the first five or ten minutes i was
28:31 - doing my research it looks like i came
28:33 - on this one first and then i came across
28:34 - this one and i guess this is the third
28:35 - one here
28:36 - and then so i was like what are the
28:38 - general characteristics of these
28:39 - and something that this guy mentioned i
28:42 - believe in the review
28:42 - or at least actually i think this was
28:45 - one of the negative reviews
28:46 - was that the kryptonite lock i mean i'm
28:50 - sure this doesn't happen to all of them
28:51 - but
28:52 - you know he left it out in the rain once
28:53 - and then boom the lock would stick
28:55 - and it wouldn't open anymore so not very
28:57 - weatherproof now if you're like a bike
28:59 - commuter in seattle
29:00 - that would not be the lock for you right
29:02 - because it's raining all the time or you
29:04 - get mud in it
29:05 - and can you just rinse it off and will
29:06 - it just just work
29:08 - after that we'll keep working
29:09 - maintenance free um and
29:12 - so that was one of the considerations
29:15 - here
29:15 - um and i'm generalizing i really hope
29:17 - i'm not saying wrong things you know
29:18 - like i said
29:19 - depending on how big a purchase it is i
29:21 - will do more or less research so when i
29:23 - bought my tv which was maybe
29:24 - mmm 600 or so i mean i got it on sale
29:28 - because i do that too i went for sales
29:30 - but i did a lot more research there
29:32 - because that's a lot more money you know
29:33 - i'm not saying a hundred dollars for a
29:35 - bike like isn't a lot of money
29:36 - it certainly is um especially since some
29:38 - people tried to get away with
29:40 - substantially less protection for their
29:41 - bikes than that but
29:42 - you know i try to balance the amount of
29:44 - research i do with how expensive
29:45 - something is so i'm not going to knock
29:47 - myself out
29:48 - you know doing two hours of research if
29:50 - i'm buying five dollar paper towels
29:51 - right
29:52 - um but anyway in so far as what i've
29:55 - read
29:55 - um abos the german brand more expensive
29:59 - um might hold up in weather better
30:00 - kryptonite good value
30:02 - um excellent value um a little bit less
30:05 - expensive than this
30:06 - maybe has a few more fit and finish
30:08 - things you know it's manufactured i
30:10 - think the manufacturing's outsourced
30:12 - which to me is usually a good thing it
30:14 - usually means the prices are lower
30:15 - for reasonable similar comparable
30:17 - quality
30:18 - i mean this this one here is more like
30:20 - the budget i'm generalizing like i said
30:22 - from the research i did
30:23 - which means it's about half the cost of
30:25 - these two but still pretty good quality
30:27 - um but you know i'm not particularly
30:29 - wanting um you know i can afford
30:31 - a somewhat better bike lock and like i
30:32 - said my bike's pretty expensive so i do
30:34 - want to lock it up with something good
30:36 - um so i was mostly debating between
30:38 - these two um i did
30:39 - i think end up deciding to go with this
30:41 - one um
30:43 - because when i was comparing the three
30:45 - standard u-lock so
30:46 - i want a u-lock like i said you know a
30:48 - handy-dandy comparison like i said i
30:49 - like this site shout out to this guy
30:51 - um i was looking at the third party
30:54 - ratings
30:55 - um now you want to make sure that they
30:57 - don't get like paid for doing
30:59 - reviews or ratings you know that's
31:00 - something that it's unfortunately
31:02 - rampant in a lot of product review sites
31:04 - you know they get paid for reviewing
31:05 - something and then you really can't take
31:06 - them at their word because they they
31:08 - have financial conflicts of interest but
31:10 - these folks here who test the bike locks
31:11 - are you know i did my i don't have the
31:13 - taps pulled up anymore but i did look
31:14 - them up
31:15 - like they're legit testing parties they
31:17 - don't get kickbacks from this
31:18 - and whatever um so you can see that the
31:21 - the more budget brand only has
31:23 - you know a review from one of the people
31:25 - which i mean it's good
31:26 - it's on the same level as these right
31:28 - and like i said if you're looking for a
31:29 - lock-in
31:30 - you don't have the budget looks like
31:32 - this is a great option right but i was
31:33 - looking between these two brands
31:35 - and so this brand the kryptonite one
31:38 - has one more star from this reviewer
31:41 - uh or like this reviewing firm than this
31:44 - one but you can see it's a full
31:46 - pound in like 1.25 pounds heavier i mean
31:48 - the other thing was
31:50 - that this company from the research that
31:52 - i've done
31:53 - tentatively generally has like smoother
31:55 - operation in their keys
31:57 - and the reliability and stuff um
32:00 - so this was my research you know i got
32:02 - here and i said you know what
32:04 - this one would be fine i'd be happy with
32:06 - this one this is
32:07 - the best basically the best you lock
32:09 - this company makes this is the best you
32:10 - like this company makes
32:12 - and they're both not that expensive
32:14 - they're both good bang for your buck i
32:15 - could do with either one of these i
32:17 - think i did decide to go
32:18 - for this one just because it's about a
32:19 - pound lighter and if i'm going to be
32:20 - lugging it around all the time well
32:22 - you know that's good for similar-ish
32:23 - security and perhaps
32:25 - handles wet weather better which if i'm
32:27 - locking it out in the rain well
32:28 - kind of needs to handle that right so
32:30 - that was my thought process
32:31 - there you go this is the one i'm
32:33 - planning on going with um
32:35 - next thing okay so this isn't something
32:37 - i'm buying now i do have this
32:38 - um this to me was uh
32:42 - uh my attempt to still be able to have
32:44 - my cake and eat it too
32:45 - literally um so i have somewhat of a
32:48 - sweet tooth but i've been trying to eat
32:49 - a lot healthier
32:50 - um and so the macros on this are pretty
32:53 - good
32:54 - um so you make it with i mean they
32:56 - changed the recipe honestly which i
32:58 - wasn't so happy about
32:59 - but it's the same stuff really as what i
33:00 - was using before i think the new thing
33:02 - calls for butter coconut oil and i still
33:04 - use
33:05 - uh avocado oil um you could also use uh
33:08 - you know something tasteless that's high
33:10 - in monounsaturated fats rather than
33:11 - polyunsaturated
33:13 - um but they're brownies basically
33:16 - but they're basically sugar-free
33:18 - brownies because they're sweetened with
33:20 - erythritol
33:21 - and stevia rather than sugar um so
33:25 - uh macro wise i pair these when i'm
33:28 - drinking my protein shake
33:29 - and then um you know you can see per
33:32 - brownie you get
33:33 - 11 grams of fiber and less than two
33:35 - grams of fat
33:36 - right and so if i'm having 25 grams of
33:39 - protein when i'm drinking my protein you
33:41 - know my my chocolate milkshake with this
33:43 - that's my dessert and so my dessert i
33:45 - get more than 10 grams of fiber and more
33:47 - than
33:47 - like 20 to 25 grams of protein that's
33:49 - pretty good macros and it tastes good
33:51 - too
33:52 - so anyway plug for this i use it i like
33:55 - it a lot i mean it's kind of pricey
33:56 - that's the only downside
33:57 - um and you do have to bake it so it's
34:00 - not like
34:01 - uh other desserts where you can just go
34:02 - to the store and buy it but
34:04 - baking it's not too bad but i bought
34:06 - these things
34:07 - initially when i was baking them so
34:08 - these are eight inch square baking pans
34:10 - and they're silicon and the reason why i
34:12 - got these
34:12 - was because they're cheap they're super
34:14 - cheap you get two of them for like
34:16 - i think when i got it it was like 10
34:17 - bucks or something um now you have to be
34:20 - a little bit careful
34:20 - um because if you have anything with
34:22 - liquid in it and you're not holding this
34:24 - carefully you'll spill
34:25 - um so there's downsides and you have to
34:28 - you know
34:28 - but they're really easy to clean too
34:30 - that's the other thing i've had pans
34:31 - before that have like seams
34:33 - in them metal seams at the edges that
34:36 - get stuff stuck in them and then you
34:37 - can't get it out when you wash so you
34:39 - can actually turn these things inside
34:40 - out which makes them super easy to clean
34:42 - so really cheap easy to clean also you
34:44 - know safe
34:45 - silicone is a cooking safe you don't
34:47 - have to worry about plastics leaching
34:48 - into your food
34:49 - so that's why i got these initially but
34:51 - it turns out
34:52 - that i haven't thought things through
34:55 - because guess what when i'm using this
34:56 - brownie mix
34:57 - i can't mix it in the silicone pan
34:59 - because it's floppy you know it flops
35:01 - around
35:01 - so i can't mix it in the same pan that i
35:03 - bake it in which means i get two things
35:05 - dirty
35:05 - every time i make my brownies and so i
35:07 - was like okay you know what that's not
35:09 - cool
35:09 - um so what i'm trying to do now is find
35:12 - a
35:12 - a glass baking pan that's eight inch
35:14 - square because that's what the brony mix
35:16 - calls for
35:16 - and then use that instead because then
35:18 - i'll just mix the brownie bit then i'll
35:19 - just mix
35:20 - the brownie mix in the pan and i'm gonna
35:22 - bake it in and i only get one thing
35:23 - dirty it makes
35:24 - my life easy and in fact i'll just store
35:26 - it in the same pan too
35:27 - and so this was my bright idea if i can
35:30 - mix
35:30 - the brownies in the pan bake the
35:32 - brownies in the pan and then store the
35:33 - brownies in the pan
35:34 - i only ever get one thing dirty and
35:36 - that's really cool so i decided i wanted
35:39 - a baking pan that had a lid
35:40 - um so you can see there's one here um i
35:43 - was looking at the options here and so
35:45 - okay i get two pans here for 17
35:47 - i get one pan for 15 and no lid i get
35:49 - one pan for 13 with a lid
35:51 - right um or i get or
35:55 - i get um like the pyrex pyrex is one of
35:57 - the the most
35:58 - i don't want to give them more credit
36:00 - than to do but it's like i i know of
36:02 - them a lot you know i have a bunch of
36:03 - pyrex containers myself not because i
36:05 - think ooh
36:06 - i just love this company but because you
36:07 - know they they're they're the class
36:09 - container company that everyone knows of
36:11 - right um so
36:12 - i was looking at these and i decided to
36:14 - go with this one here
36:16 - just because it's exactly what i want
36:17 - it's the brownie pan oops i don't know
36:19 - what i pressed there
36:20 - that i clicked on the link it's the
36:22 - brownie pan
36:23 - that has a lid so that i can store it in
36:26 - the same pan that i
36:27 - bake it in that has nothing i don't want
36:30 - so i could get
36:30 - the amazon um i think i pulled it up
36:33 - here yeah the amazon
36:34 - two-piece set but the thing is i don't
36:36 - really need the bigger pan for anything
36:37 - at the moment
36:38 - and you could say well oh you can make
36:40 - lasagna in it if you ever have people
36:41 - over whatever well but i don't at the
36:43 - moment so
36:44 - i don't really want to buy things i
36:45 - don't need you know i'm pretty big on
36:47 - minimalism so even if i spend
36:49 - so arguably you know this gets me two
36:51 - pans for 21
36:52 - is better than one pan for 13 but if i'm
36:54 - not going to use the other one
36:56 - then i have to store it somewhere and
36:57 - stuff that i don't need and
36:59 - that just i don't like that so that's
37:01 - why i'm going with the one
37:02 - and i was also comparing the ones that
37:04 - don't have a lid but then i can't store
37:06 - it in the same pan
37:07 - i mean you could argue maybe you don't
37:08 - need to put a lid on your brownies but i
37:10 - don't know
37:11 - it keeps the air out i think they keep
37:12 - better so that was this purchase
37:14 - a little bit rambly perhaps but i want
37:16 - to be able to mix my brownies
37:18 - bake my brownies and store my brownies
37:19 - in the same pan because then i have to
37:20 - do less dishes and i'm lazy
37:22 - so that was the reasoning there
37:25 - i've only got a couple more things this
37:26 - is dragging on a little bit isn't it um
37:28 - so i need to wash my car
37:30 - um i've been putting it off for a long
37:31 - time and so
37:33 - to do that i already have a bucket that
37:35 - i used for like soaking clothes if i
37:36 - stain them or whatever so i have a
37:38 - bucket already
37:38 - so that means i need sponges and car
37:40 - wash mix so i
37:41 - go into amazon and type in car wash
37:43 - sponge and then i find
37:45 - the first one that gets me normal
37:47 - sponges
37:48 - more than one of them for cheap which is
37:50 - this one um you know like that was the
37:51 - extent of my research this is cheap
37:53 - right so i don't do lots of research
37:54 - here because you say
37:55 - okay it's got a reasonable number of
37:57 - high star reviews
37:58 - and this is the one that gets me a bunch
38:00 - of sponges for cheap and i'm
38:02 - i'm sure like if you were like a
38:03 - professional car washer
38:05 - you'd have sponge preferences but i
38:07 - really don't care i just want to get the
38:08 - worst of the grit and grime off my car
38:10 - so that was my thought process there
38:12 - like i said i do a lot less research if
38:14 - it's
38:14 - cheap stuff um and then there's that and
38:17 - then i was looking at the car wash
38:18 - solution as well
38:19 - and here's the thing i have gotten away
38:22 - with not washing my car for like six
38:23 - months i
38:24 - probably wouldn't recommend it i'm
38:25 - meaning to do it more regularly now
38:27 - so i just don't need the solution some
38:30 - people are
38:31 - are super uptight about it and they like
38:32 - wash their car every week or whatever
38:34 - i'm not you know i want to make sure
38:36 - that i don't get stuff stuck to it so
38:37 - that it like eats away at the paint and
38:39 - stuff like that but that's about my
38:40 - standard
38:41 - um so i didn't want to buy something
38:43 - that was like tons and tons of solution
38:45 - because then i'm never going to use it
38:46 - and i have
38:47 - to store it somewhere and maybe i'm
38:48 - actually i don't know if soap goes bad
38:50 - maybe that's just a food thing but
38:51 - anyway i wanted to buy something smaller
38:53 - normally when you buy in bulk you save
38:55 - money but if i wasn't going to use it
38:57 - i don't know i just wanted something
38:59 - less big so you can see i could buy
39:01 - a gallon here for 22 bucks
39:04 - or i could buy something that's like 48
39:06 - fluid ounces which is substantially less
39:08 - than a gallon for
39:09 - you know seven bucks and so this is
39:10 - actually cheaper per fluid ounce so
39:12 - i went with this one just because it's
39:13 - smaller and again you know i don't care
39:16 - i'm sure if i were a professional car
39:17 - washer or i
39:19 - like i washed like someone's ferraris or
39:21 - their lamborghinis or something then i'd
39:22 - i'd probably want the very bestest
39:25 - car soap but for this car soap is car
39:27 - soap man
39:28 - um for my purposes and so that's why i
39:30 - went with the cheap one that was
39:32 - not gonna like be overkill because i
39:34 - don't need a gallon of soap if i have
39:35 - one car and i only wash it a couple
39:37 - times a year
39:38 - okay so car soap and then
39:41 - this one i need a notebook that i can
39:43 - record
39:44 - my weightlifting stuff in so you could
39:46 - argue why don't you do it on a phone app
39:47 - well the reason for that is because it
39:49 - takes two seconds to write it down in a
39:51 - notebook whereas i have to go pull up a
39:52 - spreadsheet and stuff on my phone it's
39:53 - not as convenient
39:54 - so big big big key thing if you're
39:57 - working out in the gym
39:58 - you need to be like on task when you're
40:01 - in there you need to not goof off
40:03 - if you want to make progress you have to
40:04 - be increasing your weight over time
40:06 - um that's called like the the
40:09 - progressive resistance i think is like
40:11 - the jargony word for it
40:12 - um and i have been bad about this i have
40:14 - been stuck on the same weight for bench
40:16 - press and squat for a while now just
40:18 - because i haven't been super diligent
40:20 - keeping track of
40:21 - you know how many what's my weight how
40:23 - many reps am i doing per set and stuff
40:25 - like that and so i'm going to try to be
40:26 - writing it down every time i do
40:28 - something now
40:28 - just to be more intentional in the gym
40:30 - but i didn't have a notebook so again
40:32 - similar to the car soap
40:34 - i don't need 16 of these things because
40:37 - i'm only gonna be writing it
40:38 - like using a few lines every every week
40:40 - so if i go lyft three times a week i
40:42 - maybe go through a page in these
40:43 - notebooks like every two weeks or
40:45 - something
40:45 - i don't need 16 of them so you know
40:48 - maybe maybe you save some money
40:50 - overall because you get what 16 for 12
40:52 - bucks versus
40:53 - four for five you know like yes that's a
40:55 - better deal but
40:56 - i don't need 16 of these things that's
40:58 - why i'm going with this one
41:00 - um okay and this one
41:03 - is interesting so i was looking for a
41:05 - lock that i could that either i could
41:07 - set a timer or not a timer that either
41:10 - had an app
41:10 - on the phone to let me lock myself out
41:13 - of something now the use case for this
41:14 - if i'm trying to focus on something um
41:17 - like i have a
41:18 - set of work i want to get done i have
41:20 - filtering software set up on my computer
41:22 - to block me from certain websites or
41:24 - from certain things
41:25 - but if i have another computer like if i
41:28 - bring my work laptop home
41:29 - um and i'm trying not to avoid
41:31 - distraction i need to be able to get rid
41:33 - of the work laptop because i can't set
41:34 - up
41:35 - software on that because i don't own it
41:37 - you know i'm not an administrator on it
41:39 - but if it lets me access the internet on
41:41 - my wi-fi network and i have to have my
41:42 - wi-fi network like it has to be on
41:44 - my wi-fi network because i have to
41:46 - telework from home
41:47 - well then i need a way to remove my
41:49 - access to it if i'm really trying to
41:51 - focus and i don't want to have any
41:52 - possibility of distraction
41:54 - so some people might say oh well you're
41:55 - going to such lengths why don't you just
41:57 - have a bit of self-control
41:58 - and the thing is i like the idea of just
42:00 - being able to completely remove the
42:02 - possibility
42:03 - because then it requires no willpower on
42:04 - my part to resist it i'm gonna say oh
42:06 - i locked up my work laptop now i can't
42:08 - access it like it requires zero
42:10 - willpower on my part to go resist
42:12 - opening it up and going and wasting time
42:14 - on like say youtube or whatever
42:16 - instead of working on whatever i'm
42:18 - trying to do um
42:20 - over the weekend so i mean like it's a
42:21 - saturday this morning for me um
42:23 - and i have my work laptop at home
42:24 - because i brought it home to telework
42:25 - and
42:26 - so if i have all of my uh stuff set up
42:30 - on my own computer
42:32 - to keep me from getting distracted but i
42:34 - can just open up
42:35 - that computer and use that to get
42:37 - distracted well then that's no good i
42:38 - need to
42:39 - remove my ability to use it um so i came
42:41 - up with a couple things here
42:43 - i thought one i could just not bring it
42:44 - home i could just not tell the work ever
42:46 - and that was kind of too too harsh a
42:49 - solution for me
42:50 - so i said you know what let's see if i
42:51 - can figure out a way to remove my access
42:53 - to it but just temporarily
42:55 - so my first thought was let me find a
42:56 - lock that has like an app on my phone
42:58 - because then i can block myself out of
43:01 - that app on my phone you know there's i
43:03 - have an android smartphone and i use an
43:04 - app that lets me do that
43:06 - um however it seems like any locks that
43:09 - have wifi or bluetooth they all have
43:10 - these
43:11 - these fingerprint readers and that's not
43:12 - what i'm looking for because i want a
43:14 - way to
43:14 - to remove my access from it not other
43:16 - people's i want to lock myself out of it
43:18 - but only for a short period of time um
43:20 - and so i said okay no bueno
43:22 - all of these things have fingerprint
43:23 - readers so the next thing i did was i
43:25 - went and searched for a smart lock
43:26 - and then you've never come across this
43:28 - is one of the more advanced type things
43:30 - you can do with search engines
43:31 - i said i want to find a smart lock that
43:33 - doesn't contain the word fingerprint in
43:35 - it
43:35 - um and so you see i found some stuff and
43:37 - i was like you know what wait wait wait
43:38 - so i could buy a lock
43:40 - and then temporarily block myself out of
43:42 - the app that lets me open it on my
43:44 - smartphone
43:45 - isn't that basically a timer lock so
43:47 - then i thought aha what if i search for
43:49 - timer locks explicitly
43:50 - and then i guess i skipped the page that
43:52 - had these i found one
43:54 - so you know it's like a lock that has a
43:56 - simple timer on it
43:58 - and then once you lock it you lock
44:00 - yourself out now if you look at this
44:01 - this isn't going to keep anyone out of
44:03 - something seriously
44:04 - and you might say oh well stephen that's
44:06 - a bad thing so i'm going to be smart and
44:07 - i'm going to lock up my wire cutters too
44:09 - but if i ever really needed to get to my
44:11 - work laptop like
44:12 - something's crashing and burning and
44:15 - they need me to come and work overtime
44:16 - on the weekend
44:17 - because you know like we have to deliver
44:19 - something to the customer and
44:20 - everything's broken if i really needed
44:22 - to i could just run to walmart and buy a
44:24 - pair of wire cutters and i could i could
44:26 - get rid of it if i really needed to
44:28 - right the point is removing
44:30 - removing the easy access is what i'm
44:32 - after so i've actually viewed this fact
44:34 - that
44:34 - if i can't get it open with my hands
44:36 - that's good enough because i don't want
44:38 - it to be like
44:38 - ridiculous because i want to be able to
44:40 - get in if i really need to
44:42 - right um but this is exactly what i
44:44 - needed to do
44:45 - and it turns out that i don't need to
44:46 - get my smartphone involved at all
44:48 - right so i don't want to pay 40 bucks
44:50 - for a fancy bluetooth wi-fi app
44:52 - that like i mean i don't need the app on
44:55 - my phone what's important to me is being
44:56 - able to remove my access to something
44:58 - for a period of time
44:59 - right like i said the main use case for
45:00 - me is when i'm trying to focus
45:02 - over the weekend i want to get rid of
45:06 - the ability for me to just get around my
45:07 - own
45:08 - my own filtering with my work laptop so
45:12 - there you go um i have no idea how long
45:13 - this video dragged on probably like 30
45:15 - minutes so
45:16 - well if you listen to it congratulations
45:18 - you've now seen a whole bunch of the
45:20 - random products that i'm buying in the
45:21 - next week but
45:22 - this is the sort of thing that i'm going
45:24 - to try to keep doing moving forward um
45:26 - and just going through the decision
45:28 - making process that i do whenever i buy
45:30 - stuff
45:30 - again part of this is just for me so
45:32 - that i can come back and refer to this
45:34 - over time but
45:35 - also if you ever wanted to buy whey
45:37 - protein powder
45:38 - or wet wipes or a bike lock or
45:41 - i don't know car wash sponges you
45:43 - probably don't care about those but you
45:44 - know
45:45 - perhaps you learned something if you
45:47 - were interested in any of these things
45:48 - too
45:49 - um so this is the first video like i
45:51 - said and
45:52 - i'm going to try to hold myself to doing
45:54 - this moving forward as well
